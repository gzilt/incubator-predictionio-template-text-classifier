    <content>Two Sinag Maynila films join int’l fests
    
    
    Oliver Aquino in “Tale of the Lost Boys”
    Two feature film finalists in this year’s Sinag Maynila will have screenings in international festivals.
    Joselito Altarejos Jr.’s “Tale of the Lost Boys” is part of the lineup of the Outfest Fusion in Los Angeles in the United States, from March 9 to 13. Meanwhile, Ralston Jover’s “Bomba” is included in the Windows of the World feature film competition of the 28th Festival Cinema Africano, Asia e America Latina, from March 18 to 25 in Milan, Italy.
    “It’s a great way to start the new year,” Altarejos said of the LA outing. “It actually physicalizes my personal recovery—

    having been under therapy and medication for two years to manage my bipolar condition. It’s just amazing!”

    Altarejos is determined to “make new friends and mend past relationships” during the two fests.
    He related that his film “crosses gender, and hurdles, cultural and language barriers in its journey toward finding a certain sense of identity for its characters”—a Filipino mechanic and a closeted Taiwanese. “The issue of identity is a basic human quest.”
    Allen Dizon in “Bomba”
    Jover considers the screenings in Manila and Milan “consecutive blessings” for “Bomba.”
    “A few days after Sinag Maynila, ‘Bomba’ will compete and have a weeklong theatrical run in Italy,” Jover explained.
    “Bomba,” which centers on a deaf laborer who’s pushed over the edge, will be competing with films from Africa, Asia and Latin America in Milan.
    Apart from “Bomba” and “Tale of the Lost Boys,” the other entries in the feature film section of Sinag Maynila are Yam Laranas’ “Abomination,” Richard Somes’ “El Peste” and Miguel Victor Pastor’s “Melodrama/Random/Melbourne!”
    The Sinag Maynila film fest will be held from March 7 to 15 in select SM Cinemas.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    <content>Lav’s martial law musical: Never again!
    
    
    “Halimaw” ensemble (from left): Bituin Escalante, Bart Guingona, Pinky Amador and Piolo Pascual
    Apart from popular stars like Piolo Pascual and Shaina Magdayao, Lav Diaz tapped theater thespians like Bituin Escalante, Bart Guingona and Pinky Amador for his latest endeavor, the martial law musical “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw” (Season of the Devil)—an entry in the main tilt of the Berlinale, ongoing until Feb. 25.
    Known primarily as a singer, Escalante is also considered a seasoned theater actress, having lent her powerful pipes to the local productions of “Rent” and “Dreamgirls.” Still, she is actually a first-timer on the set of a Diaz film.
    The newbie, however, didn’t have much difficulty shifting from stage to screen. “Lav is so relaxed and very collaborative … almost improvisational. Masarap katrabaho (A pleasure to work with),” recalled Escalante who portrays “Kwentista,” the storyteller and conscience of the lead character (Pascual).

    She admitted that “there is a sense of pride in having our premiere in such a prestigious festival. Given our ‘colonial mentality,’ it might do the film well to be recognized abroad.”

    But she feels strongly about having screenings in the Philippines, too. “Gusto ko talagang makapanood nito ay ang mga kababayan ko. (I want my countrymen to see it.)”
    She explained: “It’s important to tell this story because we have to counter all the historical revisionism happening in our country now. This happened, and we must never let it happen again.”
    Escalante flew to Berlin, where she stayed for only three days. “I had to fly
    back to Manila, for the play ‘Himala, Isang Musikal.’”
    Early reviews are tentatively mixed, but Escalante was singled out by The Hollywood Reporter’s Clarence Tsui as “wonderfully voiced.” Meanwhile, Screen International’s Jonathan Romney pointed out that not all the cast members are “natural singers,” a function of the film’s “Brechtian/distantiation strategy,” but Escalante “brings the soundtrack to
    life with her authoritative
    interventions.”
    Unlike Escalante, Guingona is a Diaz regular, having collaborated with the Venice-winning filmmaker half a dozen times “including in some yet-to-be-released titles.”
    Guingona described Diaz as “an actor’s dream director.”
    He clarified: “Working with him requires mutual trust … That makes it gratifying, because you level up to each other’s standards. It’s a professional way of practicing the craft.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Guingona, who plays Paham the village wise man in the film, was one of the first members of the team to arrive in Berlin, along with Diaz and producers Bianca Balbuena and Bradley Liew and coactor Hazel Orencio.
    He owned up: “I am excited, well, nervous really for our screenings. We sing our dialogue (a cappella in the movie), which brings out more of our emotions.”
    He asserted: “The story is an allegory for our times. It’s brave, unflinching and as dark as the times we live in today. I hope people get that.”
    The last time Amador worked with Diaz was in the 2002 film “Hesus, Rebolusyonaryo.” “But Lav’s form and style have changed since then.”
    Amador, who was an original cast member of West End’s “Miss Saigon” in the 1990s, admitted that the experience was initially “nerve-wracking.”
    Although she was in the middle of rehearsing a play in Manila, she opted to stay in Malaysia, where the film was shot, all throughout the 18-day filming. “My scenes, including the solo, were the first to be filmed.” It felt like a huge responsibility to start the ball rolling, she recalled.
    Amador, who plays Kwago (a widow ostracized as an aswang by the militia), detected a “pasyon”-like quality in the film’s music.
    In a lot of ways, the film retraces the nation’s calvary during the bleak days of martial rule. It’s imperative to tell this story, she insisted, “because the world is full of hate and confusion, we need a beam of light.”
    In any case, she pointed out, the atrocities depicted in the film happened, and are still happening, not only in the Philippines, but all over the world. “It’s universal. It’s something we cannot hide.”

    <content>IndieWire: ‘Halimaw’ is one of Berlinale’s 10 must-see films
    
    
    “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw”
    IndieWire critics David Ehrlich and Eric Kohn have chosen Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz’s “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw” (Season of the Devil) as one of the “10 must-see films” at the Berlinale, ongoing in Germany until Feb. 25.
    The duo sums up this year’s Berlin lineup as “an incredibly eclectic (and almost overwhelmingly large) cornucopia of new cinema.”
    Diaz’s latest film is on the same “required watching” list as Wes Anderson’s “Isle of Dogs” and Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane.”

    Kohn points out: “Diaz makes very, very long movies…

    but they’re always worthwhile for viewers willing to embrace the challenge.”
    He describes Diaz’s oeuvre as “deep-dives into his country’s troubled history, [which]…
    often wows festival juries unprepared for his ambition.”
    “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw” is one such polemical plunge into the Philippines’ past—specifically tackling the disappearance of a progressive doctor in an isolated village ruled by a militia during the Marcos era.
    “The culture of fear percolates throughout the small community,” Kohn recounts the story of the film which “explores the nuances of life under martial law.”
    What makes Diaz’s latest outing different, Kohn asserts, is that it’s a musical. “Or something like it. Diaz has called the movie ‘an antimusical, a rock opera, whatever you want to call it.’ (How about a Lav Diaz movie? That’s always worked before.)”
    Singularity of vision
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Kohn remarks: “Few working filmmakers produce such uncompromising work with the singularity of vision that Diaz has maintained, so this one is certain to be a conversation-starter at the 2018 Berlinale.”
    Producer Bianca Balbuena says of the indieWire essay: “Being considered as one of ‘10 must-see’ movies among the 400 films showing at the Berlinale was a big surprise. I was so excited that I immediately told the whole cast about it.”
    Shaina Magdayao in “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw”
    At the same time, however, Balbuena was also prepared for the early positive buzz. “As a big fan of Lav, I was somehow expecting that the festival audience would be curious to see him do a musical.”
    She sums up the film as “painful to watch.” “It’s so true, so straightforward, so angry, brave and yet so poetically crafted. That’s the magic of Lav.”
    Diaz and the rest of the “Halimaw” team started arriving in Berlin last Saturday, but lead actor Piolo Pascual would be flying in an hour before the red carpet world premiere tomorrow.
    Other screening dates of Diaz’s film in Berlin are on Feb. 21 (12:30  and 6:30 p.m.) and Feb. 22 (9:30 a.m.).

    Internationally acclaimed Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” (The Woman Who Left) began its screenings in 30 cinemas in Germany on Feb. 4.
    Apart from Berlin, the Filipino film is also showing in other German cities like Cologne, Dresden, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hannover, Leipzig, Munich and Nuremberg.
    The website of the Hamburg International Film Festival, where “Humayo” was shown two years ago, commends Diaz for “creating a visually overwhelming, archaic and deeply human drama about guilt and solidarity, absolution and revenge.”

    Die Zeit’s Katja Nicodemus calls it “a story of survival, a look at society, its violence and crime, and at the same time an über film that puts the means of cinema in the direction of poetic freedom.”
    Süddeutsche Zeitung points out: “With [this film], Diaz has created a lesson, a commitment to didactic simplicity.”
    Zeit Online’s Anke Leweke describes the Venice-winning Filipino film as a “masterpiece.”
    Leweke relates: “The quiet attitudes of the Filipino director develop a pull…a surprising presence that makes us forget our own time.”
    The reviewer asserts that Diaz’s valiant heroine (played by Charo Santos-Concio) is “a woman whose family, loved ones and life have been destroyed by decadeslong imprisonment, but [still refuses] to be deprived of her humanity.”
    According to Lenke, Diaz is a “time-teller…in the concrete sense. The viewer discovers an insecure, torn country that wants to breathe again after the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. But corruption…is omnipresent.”
    Lenke remarks that Diaz “combines the history of violence in the Philippines with an empathic, investigative look at people and their life stories.”

    Seno told the Inquirer that the Paris-based sales agent Reel Suspects had acquired her film, an entry in last year’s Cinema One fest.
    According to Screen International, Reel Suspects’ Matteo Lovadina commended Seno’s “remarkable talent,” which captures a “narrow and magical universe, threatened by incomprehensible adults.”
    He noted that the film was “an exceptional and pleasant experience for the audience.”
    He asserted: “In very rare occasions, we’ve seen this pure innocence and candidness of childhood so well-portrayed onscreen.”
    Lovadina expressed the hope that “festival directors and buyers will have the time to sit down and breathe, to enjoy the lightness of this masterpiece.”
    Seno told website De Filmkrant that her films revolve around “the pressure of growing up.”
    She is now working on her next movie, “The Wild Duck,” “a series of vignettes on a middle-aged Filipino migrant who stumbles on a bird’s nest in his backyard in suburban Los Angeles.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Oliver Aquino in “Tale of the Lost Boys”
    Filipino films will be shown in two festivals in Myanmar and Egypt.
    Joselito Altarejos’ “Tale of the Lost Boys” will be featured at the 4th &amp;Proud Yangon Film Festival in Myanmar from Feb. 1 to 4. Meanwhile, Arbi Barbarona’s “Tu Pug Imatuy” (Right to Kill) will compete in the Freedom and Human Rights section of the 7th Luxor African Film Festival in Egypt, from March 16 to 22.
    “I hope to find more similarities between us and the people of Myanmar, in terms of LGBT experiences and culture,” Altarejos told the Inquirer. “I also want to learn more about the struggle of the LGBT community for acceptance in their society.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Altarejos said that he plans to acquire “first-hand information from the people of Myanmar on the plight of the Rohingya refugees, as well.”

    According to its website, &amp;Proud gathers “films across Southeast Asia which reflect the diversity of LGBT lives and political movements in the world.”
    Altarejos, however, expressed a simple wish—for his film to have a theatrical run in the Philippines soon.
    “Tu Pug Imatuy”
    For his part, Barbarona asserted: “It’s an honor to be the only Asian film to be invited to the Luxor African fest, especially for a section that highlights human rights and the dignity of people.”
    Barbarona remarked: “It’s important for audiences to watch ‘Tu Pug Imatuy’ because it tackles the same advocacies pursued by people everywhere: the struggle for human rights, land reform and other noteworthy aspirations.”
    Hopefully, viewers from Egypt and other countries will be able to see and compare their situation with ours, he said. “So that we can discuss different issues more thoroughly and [determine] how we can move forward in the future.”
    The Luxor fest “aims to support and encourage African film productions and partnerships between different countries.”
    “Tu Pug Imatuy” was the opening film at the 10th Cinemagis Digital Short Film Festival held in Cagayan de Oro recently.

    Malaysian director Bradley Liew’s second film, “Motel Acacia,” is joining the Berlinale Co-Production Market, which will be held from Feb. 17 to 21, in conjunction with the A-list festival in Germany.
    “We’re super excited as this is the biggest project market we’ll be attending,” said Liew, who made his directorial debut with the Pepe Smith starrer, “Singing in Graveyards.”
    “We’re hoping that this event will help us find our international partners because we’re planning to shoot in the snow.”

    The thriller is set in a sex motel where immigrants are “exterminated,” with the assistance of a tree demon.
    Liew is eyeing Filipino actors Angel Aquino and JC Santos to topbill the film.
    “Motel Acacia” likewise participated in the Sam Spiegel International Film Lab, Eave Ties That Bind, Bucheon’s NAFF IT Project, and Talents Tokyo Next Masters Support Program.
    With partner Bianca Balbuena, Liew is also a producer of Lav Diaz’s latest film, the musical “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw” (Season of the Devil), which will premiere in the main tilt of the Berlinale next month.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Filmmaker Sigrid Andrea Bernardo said she didn’t think she would be able to cross over from indie to mainstream—or that there was actually any need to. After all, she pointed out, she didn’t believe that there should be such demarcation at all.
    “It’s possible to make the jump—tiyaga lang talaga. But for me, at the end of the day, it’s all about making films that you want, films that you think the people will love,” she said at a recent press conference for her new movie, “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cruz (opens Jan. 24).
    “Personal happiness is important. Releasing a movie you’re not happy with will haunt you forever. The movie may not earn well or receive good reviews, but as long as you’re happy with it, everything will be fine,” said Bernardo, who’s slowly getting used to dealing with overeager producers wanting to have a hand in her work.

    The Philippines’ Allen Dizon won best actor for Ralston Jover’s “Bomba” in the Asian Film competition of the 16th Dhaka International Film Festival held in Bangladesh on Saturday night.
    Dizon told the Inquirer that the mood at the closing ceremony’s venue, the National Library of Dhaka, was electric. He recalled that the Filipino community, led by representatives from the Philippine embassy, in Dhaka had attended the ceremony and cheered him on.
    “I am very grateful for their show of support,” Dizon said, adding that he shares the honor with his family, the cast and crew of “Bomba”—particularly, costar Angellie Sanoy.

    It is the third time for a film topbilled by Dizon to participate at the Dhaka fest. “But it’s my first time to win,” he remarked.
    He was previously in the running for best actor at the Dhaka fest for Joel Lamangan’s “Sekyu” in 2016 and for Victor Acedillo Jr.’s “Lando at Bugoy” in 2017.
    Third time’s the charm for Allen who is no stranger to international awards, having won a number of acting citations abroad. /je

    <content>Sundance debuts dark tale of triplets split at birth
    
    
    “Three Indentical Strangers” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2018 © Sundance Institute / RAW TV through AFP
    If it were a conspiracy thriller it would be dismissed as far-fetched, but Tim Wardell’s astonishing story of triplets separated at birth and reunited by pure chance is all too real.
    
    
    His debut feature documentary “Three Identical Strangers,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday, introduces Bobby Shafran, Eddy Galland and David Kellman, who had no idea they were triplets until the age of 19.
    But don’t expect “The Parent Trap,” for this altogether darker film shows how the trio’s joyous reunion set in motion a chain of events that unearthed a conspiracy that went far beyond their own lives.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The amazing saga began in 1980 when Shafran enrolled at Sullivan County Community College, a two-hour drive north of New York, and was told he had a double called Eddy Galland, who had just quit.

    Shafran tracked down Galland and, sure enough, they were stunned to find they looked exactly alike, and had the same birthday, interests, voices, mannerisms and even hands.
    The chance reunion of twins separated at birth was enough to make the front pages of the local tabloids but the coverage unearthed a far more intriguing story.
    Kellman was reading about the newly-acquainted brothers and realized he, too, looked exactly like them, shared their birthday and was also adopted.
    The men hit it off immediately, moving in together, transferring to the same degree course in international marketing.
    The public lapped up their inspiring story and they became celebrities in the Manhattan club scene, even making cameo appearances in Madonna’s first major movie, “Desperately Seeking Susan.”
    ‘Complete surrealism’
    “The initial meeting was just complete surrealism. These things that were happening were just so unreal that they were almost dreamlike,” Shafran told AFP.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “But then once we got together there was a joy that I had never experienced in my life and it lasted a really long time.”
    They opened a restaurant — Triplets — selling Eastern European fare and had a ball in the early days, but eventually tempers began to fray as arguments flared over work responsibilities.
    Wardle uses a mix of reenactments and interviews with Shafran and Kellman, now 56, to deliver the first bombshell — a disillusioned Shafran quitting the business.
    Then the story takes a tragic turn as it is revealed that Galland had become increasingly depressed and unstable, eventually taking his own life at the age of 33.
    The mystery around their infancy — why they knew nothing about each other despite growing up within a 100-mile radius — took another twist as journalist and writer Lawrence Wright made a stunning discovery.
    The triplets, it turned out, were among a number of identical siblings split up as part of a dark 1960s “nature versus nurture” social experiment led by psychoanalyst Peter Neubauer of the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services in Manhattan.
    Visits by researchers throughout their childhoods were explained away as a “child development study” when in reality Neubauer was scrutinizing the brothers’ personalities and relationships with their very diverse adoptive families.
    “We really didn’t understand just how egregiously these people behaved,” said Kellman, who told AFP all six adoptive parents were angered that they too had been kept in the dark.
    “As we got older, got married, became parents ourselves, we realized how impactful it was.”
    ‘Victims, not participants’
    Wardle, who came across the story while scouting for new documentary ideas and has spent five years on the film, describes the story as “one of most extraordinary” he’d ever heard.
    “Right from the off they are very characterful, warm people but there was also a degree of mistrust, which I completely understand,” he told AFP.
    “When you hear the full depth of their story and what has happened to them it’s quite understandable that they’d be a bit wary of people.”
    The Jewish Board finally agreed to give the surviving brothers access to 100,000 pages of heavily-redacted notes on their evaluations after filming was completed.
    But these were far from a formal research paper and included no explanation as to what Neubauer was doing and why, or what his researchers had learned.
    Kellman went on running the restaurant for another five years but with Shafran out of the picture and Eddy no longer alive, the venture rather lost its luster.
    He went on to work as an insurance consultant while Shafran became an attorney.
    No one has ever apologized to Shafran or Kellman, and the Jewish Board declined to take part in the documentary.
    A spokeswoman told AFP it was “committed to providing identified Neubauer study participants access to their records in a timely and transparent manner.”
    It is not the kind of language that sits easily with the brothers, however.
    “They refer to us as participants,” says Kellman. “We weren’t participants, we were victims.” MKH

    Deligero’s 20-minute film is competing for the fest’s
    top prizes (Golden and Silver Bear and the Audi Short
    Film Award).
    “Babylon” tells the story of “two girls who travel through time to assassinate a barangay dictator and revise history.” Deligero directed the Cinema One Originals films, “Iskalawags” in 2013 and “Lily” in 2016.
    “I have done four feature films—Cebuano films,” Deligero recalled. “Since then, people have been telling me that the reason my films are not invited to international festivals is because they’re too local.”
    He recounted that he shot “Babylon” 10 years after making his first short film (“Uwan Init Pista sa Langit”) in 2007.
    “Winning best short film at QCinema and being in competition at the Berlinale is the best way to celebrate a decade of making very ‘local’ films with good friends,” he said. “Local is international.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Andi Eigenmann and Khalil Ramos are set to star in the indie film “Saturno,” which will feature the Philippines in an alternate future “where extrajudicial killings have reached a breaking point.”
    The film’s Indiegogo page announced on Jan. 15 that the leads had been cast after a month of pre-production and that shooting would begin in 10 days.
    “Saturno” is director Bianca Catbagan’s thesis film. A graduate student at Columbia University, she co-directed the 2012 film “Suntok sa Buwan,” starring Nonie Buencamino and Joem Bascon.

    The film raised $13,120 (approximately P665,000), which will cover production costs as it will be shot outside of Manila.

    Protagonist Luna (Eigenmann) is described as an 18-year-old who’s “a child in years, an adult by circumstance.” Ramos will play her brother Marco who is a victim of a drug-bust operation. The film will explore Luna’s efforts to get money and pay for her brother’s burial. 
    Eigenmann starred in “Ma’ Rosa,” which was featured at the Cannes Film Festival, and “Camp Sawi.” Ramos’ works include “2 Cool 2 Be 4Gotten” and “Honor Thy Father.”
    “Growing up in the Philippines, I know what it’s like to fear for your own safety,” Catbagan writes on the fundraising page.
    “In spite of all this, I still think that we’re unjustly allowing the murder of men, women and children on our own streets through this drug war. Why do we Filipinos consent to this?”
    She explains that the political film was written “because I see many Filipinos look away from the violence happening in front of their eyes, refusing to acknowledge that their hands are as blood-stained as the policemen carrying out official orders.” 
    The film aims to project “a chilling environment in the hopes of making the audience feel scared and uncomfortable, especially since this is where we may be headed in the near future,” she says. /ra

    <content>WATCH: Warner Bros. OKs conditional release of Harry Potter fan film about Voldemort
    
    
    The fan-made film about the origins of Harry Potter’s nemesis, Voldemort, has been released online and can be viewed freely via YouTube.
    Made by Italian production house Tryangle Films, “Voldemort: Origins of the Heir” has a runtime of around 50 minutes.

    Originally a Kickstarter campaign, the film had received a take-down notice from Warner Bros., indefinitely putting production on hold.

    The Independent reported that the two parties found common ground, with Warner Bros. giving its blessing only if the film would be released for free.
    “Origins of the Heir” was initially shot in Italian. The release, however, has been dubbed in English with subtitles available in other languages.
    Inspiration for the movie came from JK Rowling’s sixth Harry Potter novel, “The Half-Blood Prince.” Director Gianmaria Pezzato said the film had been created to further explore Tom Marvolo Riddle’s past–what went on in Riddle’s past that made him into Voldemort.
    “We wondered, ‘What made Tom Riddle become Voldemort?’” said Pezzato. “What happened in those years, and what really went down at Hogwarts when he came back?”
    Pezzato also alludes to various clues sprinkled throughout the book series. The film is an attempt to bring all those clues into a single cohesive narrative. Alfred Bayle /ra

    Allen Dizon in “Bomba”
    Three Filipino movies will be shown at the 16th Dhaka International Film Festival in Bangladesh from Jan. 12 to 20.
    Ralston Jover’s “Bomba” and Joseph Israel Laban’s “Baconaua” are part of the Asian Film Competition, while Sonny Calvento’s “Nabubulok” is included in the Cinema of the World section.
    Calvento remarked: “I’m honored that, after Busan, ‘Nabubulok’ has been invited to Dhaka.” He feels “sincerely happy that international film fests in Asia consider our film something worth sharing to their audiences.”

    “I hope that this inspires aspiring filmmakers to create and put their work out there,” Calvento asserted.

    Laban said: “I’m grateful to be part of Dhaka. It’s my third film to be screened there and the fourth international film fest for ‘Baconaua,” after Busan, Tallinn and Chennai.”
    “I am thankful to the programmers who found our film worthy of competing in the main tilt,” Jover noted.
    “Bomba” lead actor Allen Dizon will attend the Dhaka fest for the second time. He first participated in the event in 2016 for Joel Lamangan’s “Sekyu.” “Bomba” is the third Dizon film in Dhaka; the second was Vic Acedillo Jr.’s “Lando at Bugoy” in 2017.
    According to the fest’s website, the event seeks “to create a better understanding of world cinema in an atmosphere of appreciation of film culture.” The fest’s motto is: “Better film, better audience, better society.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    <content>Damon, Affleck hope ‘Bending the Arc’ inspires millennials

    PARK CITY, Utah — The story of the global nonprofit Partners in Health is the story of a few young idealists who couldn’t have started any smaller — trying to delivery primary health care in rural Haiti 30 years ago. With no structures, little money, undaunted spirits and a belief that all lives are worth saving, the tireless work of Paul Farmer, Jim Yong Kim and Ophelia Dahl revolutionized the global health movement.
    Partners in Health now employs 18,000 people and impacts rural communities around the world. Their story is recounted in the documentary “Bending the Arc,” from directors Kief Davidson and Pedro Kos, which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival.
    “Paul and Jim and Ophelia are personal heroes for me,” Matt Damon said recently by phone.

    Damon’s an executive producer on the film, as is Ben Affleck. Both have known Farmer for years, having sought him out for his extraordinary contributions to the global health care movement. Affleck met him in Rwanda, Damon met him in Haiti, and both civic-minded Hollywood stars didn’t blink at lending their support to the project when producer Cori Shepherd Stern approached them.

    Both believe the film will be inspiring and galvanizing for millennials as they seek a theatrical distributor at Sundance.
    “What’s so great about their story is it didn’t start grand and big,” said Damon. “It started with these people who had incredible passion.”
    Affleck, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, was drawn to the fact that the three-decade partnership all started with a shared conviction that, “preventable suffering was totally unacceptable.”
    For Dahl, when she thinks about it, the origin of the movement really goes back to their upbringings, where they’d been socialized to expect the best, or at least know that when things go wrong, that there are always steps you can take to make it better.
    “When I went to central Haiti and saw what I saw there, it kind of in some ways didn’t occur to me that we couldn’t improve it in some way,” Dahl said. “It’s the good side of arrogance. You don’t expect it for yourself and if you can translate that and think that it should be much better for all of these people, and you put into it the same kind of effort that you would looking after your own children, your own parents, and you see results, that’s really powerful to see things happen.”
    Stern got started pursuing the story in 2003, following the publication of Tracy Kidder’s book about Farmer, “Mountains Beyond Mountains.” It took over seven years to make “Bending the Arc,” which chronicles the origins and the strides Farmer, Dahl and Kim made in treating tuberculosis and HIV in developing countries through community-based care, fair pricing and global funding.
    “Ultimately the story is an invitation. It’s an invitation for all of us who have some power and who can bring out voices to influence power to reject the mindset that health care is simply too hard or too expensive or too complicated,” Affleck said. “They’ve shown how to build systems that are rooted in equity and quality and efficiency and compassion. ’Bending the Arc’ brings those to life and forces us to wrestle with an urgent imperative to create a new, just health care norm for everyone.”

    Dahl is a bit worried about the new political climate under President Donald Trump, but said that throughout her years of work around the world, she’s always found people in government at every level who are willing to help. One of the most significant AIDS relief programs, PEPFAR, she notes, was started under President George W. Bush.
    “This movement for global health has gathered a lot of steam around the world,” she said. “It’s a pretty unstoppable force of people who believe in far more equality in health.”
    Damon also doesn’t know what the future holds, but hopes for the best.
    “Jim Kim’s ambition was not to run the World Bank. He was like ’I was protesting that thing 20 years ago!’ That’s the great message of the movie and the great lesson of their experience and what they did is that it started at a place of purity and passion and grew into something that’s massive and undeniable and that’s I think really a great lesson for every millennial,” Damon said. “If you can stick with something, and truly believe in something and can stay with it and find comrades in arms, you can move mountains.” –Lindsey Bahr

    Andreas Muñoz as St. Ignatius
    Paolo Dy’s “Ignacio de Loyola” won best picture at the 8th Mirabile Dictu—International Catholic Film Festival in Vatican City recently.
    The Filipino-produced film recounts the struggles and salvation of the founder of the Society of Jesus, Ignacio de Loyola or St. Ignatius, played by Spanish actor Andreas Muñoz.
    According to fest founder and organizer Liana Marabini, “Ignacio de Loyola” was the jury’s unanimous choice. “The jurors appreciated the script, the actors … the costumes, the music … in one word: everything!”

    Produced by Jesuit Communications Foundation Philippines, “Ignacio de Lo-yola” previously won the audience choice award at the 12th Cine con Valores Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico.

    Dy told the Inquirer: “I’m incredibly proud of my cast and crew, and so humbled and grateful that the Mirabile Dictu jury chose to give the Il Pesce d’Argento Award to our film. It’s such a tremendous honor for our efforts to be recognized by the festival that is closest to the heart of the Catholic Church.”
    Dy explained that St. Ignatius’ life story “doesn’t fit the mold of the typical saint narrative.” “It’s so heartening to see that our film’s message has connected with audiences and festivals all over the world, especially those that seek films about the struggle to find the light in an increasingly dark and conflict-ridden world.”
    “The film was made with blood, sweat and tears,” related producer Pauline Mangilog-Saltarin who shared the trophy with the entire team who had made the film “with so much passion and grace … [it’s] a genuine labor of love.”
    Executive producer Fr. Emmanuel Alfonso pointed out: “It came as a real surprise because it was our first attempt at filmmaking. We hope that more people will be inspired by the example of St. Ignatius.”
    The Mirabile Dictu is considered the “Oscars of Catholic films” and aims “to give space to producers and filmmakers … [whose works] promote universal moral values and positive role models.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    The filmmakers and actors who comprise the 2017 honorees
    Malaysian filmmaker Bradley Liew, who broke ground as the first non-Filipino recipient of the recent Inquirer Indie Bravo! award for “Singing in Graveyards,” stated: “I hope that the Guyito will stand as a symbol of hope to remind us that cinema has no boundaries. And that this will somehow help Southeast Asian cinema as a whole and push filmmakers to be brave and fight for free cinema.”
    In a speech read by EpicMedia colleague Lilit Reyes, Liew stated: “This [award] is for the fundamental right to free speech. For the freedom of the press. Fight for this because there’s nothing darker than a world where words are shackled.”
    First-time honoree Victor Kaiba Villanueva (“Patay na si Hesus”) said he got confused when some of the guests asked him: “‘Is this your first Guyito?’” He replied by saying: “What? I haven’t drunk anything yet,’” thinking that they were referring to an alcoholic beverage similar to mojito.

    The Cebu-based Villanueva added: “We considered making ‘Patay na si Hesus’ in Tagalog, but later decided against it. We were shocked with the audience’s positive reaction to it. We wish that there would come a time when there would be no more distinction—a film in Tagalog and a film in Cebuano are both made by Filipinos.”

    For first-time honoree Maricel Cabrera-Cariaga, the Indie Bravo! Awards last Monday was also “date night” with her mom Cecilia, who was on vacation from her work as a carer for the elderly in London.
    “She moved her flight home to an earlier date so she could attend the awards night with me,” recalled Cabrera, who is feted for her film, “Pitong Kabang Palay.”
    The director recalled that her mother “froze for a moment” upon meeting another awardee, actress Charo Santos-Concio. “My mom was starstruck. She’s been watching ‘Maalaala Mo Kaya’ for over a decade now. She’s a big fan!”
    Concio, who also heads one of the country’s biggest film companies Star Cinema, recalled her days as a neophyte actress, to inspire the doggedly determined directors who, in their acceptance speeches, recalled their struggles to find an audience in the country.
    Mario Cornejo, Coreen Jimenez,
    She recounted that when her debut film, Mike de Leon’s “Itim,” was shown in a cavernous, 1,000-seater theater in 1977, “there were only a handful of people in the cinema on opening day.”
    When another Santos starrer, De Leon’s “Kisapmata,” was fielded in the 1981 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), it placed 10th in a lineup of 10 entries, in terms of early grosses. “But after it swept the awards, winning nine out of 10 trophies, it landed in the top three at the tills by the end of the fest.”

    Honoree Baby Ruth Villarama, whose documentary “Sunday Beauty Queen” won best picture in last year’s MMFF, remarked: “It was an inspiring night to hear words of truth and encouragement from colleagues in the industry.”
    Iza Calzado,
    Filmmaker and animator Avid Liongoren, whose movie “Saving Sally” won three awards at the 37th Fantasporto fest in Portugal, hoisted his Guyito as if it were a championship cup.
    “When the film won in Portugal, I created graphics to announce the win on Facebook. I enclosed the title of the two awards I knew of in laurels. But looking at the layout, it didn’t look right, so I put another set of laurels just to balance it out,” he related. “It read, ‘Extra laurels for symmetrical purposes only.’”
    “But when the Inquirer reported about it, I learned that we actually won three awards, and that there was no need for the fake laurels!” Liongoren said.
    PDI executives Rene Reinoso and Connie Kalagayan
    Batch 2017’s youngest honoree Jared Joven, who shares the award with fellow 18-year-old director Kaj Palanca for their short film “Contestant #4,” told the Inquirer: “It’s pleasing to realize that I have more years ahead. That I can keep on exploring and making more films. I will never regret starting at a young age, and this cements my decision to continue dreaming as a filmmaker. I’m excited with what more I will discover through cinema.”
    Now, for a bit of reality check. Awardee Dexter Hemedez related: “When our film ‘1st Sem’ had its theatrical release last April, we were pitted against ‘Guardians of the Galaxy 2,’ which was shown in over 500 cinemas. We only had five theaters and all of our screenings were sliding.”
    It was “heartbreaking,” Hemedez admitted, but the CineFilipino film later brought them to different countries abroad, where it won five awards this year. “It gives us hope to keep pursuing our dreams.”

    Allan Michael Ibañez, Hemedez’s codirector, described the Indie Bravo! night as a
    “time to chat with fellow filmmakers and get encouraged by their stories.”
    For first-time honoree Samantha Lee, the award was heartening. She explained: “This will give more chances for LGBT-themed films (like her drama ‘Baka Bukas’) to be seen.”
    Awardee JP Habac, whose film “Maria” made waves abroad, expressed the hope that “short films would be given more platforms for showcase and appreciation in our country so that we might have more avenues for stimulating entertainment and voices of truth.”
    Honoree Eduardo Roy Jr. pointed out that the rise of microcinemas like Cinema ’76 has allowed indie films to have regular screenings all year round. “I made my film ‘Pamilya Ordinaryo’ almost two years ago, but until now it’s still being shown in independent movie houses. Now, we are no longer afraid of the first day-last day [syndrome].” Most indie films get pulled out of cineplexes after only one day because of poor performance at the box office.

    Vincent Nebrida, president of TBA, pledged to program the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Film Festival next month at Cinema ’76, to support this year’s awardees. TBA produced the hit historical epic, Jerrold Tarog’s “Heneral Luna,” and this year’s Indie Bravo! awardee, Sheron Dayoc’s “Women of the Weeping River.”
    He was glad that screenings of indie movies “are no longer limited during local festival runs.” Nebrida then cited similar movie theaters like Cinema Centenario on Maginhawa street in Quezon City, and Black Maria Cinema in Mandaluyong City.
    After all, dreamers are rebels, too.
    Honoree Paolo Villaluna, whose film “Pauwi Na” won the top prize at the A-list Shanghai fest, asserted: “It is invigorating to witness the community’s growth … In an era, when people can’t tell right from wrong, when fake [news] can be easily sold as truth, the voice of the filmmaker is all the more important.”
    Awardee Atom Magadia, whose film “Dagsin” was cited, noted: “Like the Indios Bravos (after whom the Indie Bravo! Awards was named), I believe today’s filmmakers are rebels, as well. We are fighting not only for recognition for our individual films, but also collectively for our country’s brand-new cinema.” —ALLAN POLICARPIO

    So, when her turn to receive her first Indie Bravo! trophy and Guyito stuffed toy finally came, the actress’ friends couldn’t help but tease her.
    She better make the most of her outfit, they quipped— “lubusin mo na!”

    Ana, whose performance in “Laut” won her the best supporting actress award at the 3rd Asean International Film Festival in Malaysia, had the crowd laughing and hooting throughout her lengthy speech that had her nervously and candidly recounting the personal and career snags she ran into the past few years.
    “Last year, after doing a soap, nag-love life ako ng konti—may potential. I got easily distracted, but I enjoyed it,” she recalled.
    Iza Calzado
    “But after two months, the bills came. And suddenly, I didn’t enjoy it as much anymore! Mercifully, I was able to do two films, ‘Laut’ and ‘2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten.’”
    Ana prayed for a new career “jumpstart.” She found herself shuttling between two churches in Australia, where she was based. “Kulang na lang yata mag-choir ako!” Back in the Philippines, Ana—who’s also into painting—mounted art exhibits.
    “Sa awa ng Diyos, nakabenta ng isa!” jested Ana, who wasn’t able to attend the Asean fest, because she had to undergo an appendectomy.
    Things did turn out for the better, eventually. Aside from the acting recognitions she has been reaping, Ana revealed that she had landed an acting job for an ABS-CBN soap.
    “To all the filmmakers and producers here, I hope you think of me during your creative moments!” she said to a round of cackles.

    Allen Dizon, Ana’s contemporary in the ’90s, said he received his fourth Guyito this year. He claimed this was a good thing because he has four kids “and they each have their own Guyitos now,” Allen beamed. Allen shared this year’s honor with “Bomba” costar Angellie Sanoy for their Warsaw victory.

    Lotlot de Leon, for her part, has two Guyitos now for her film “1st Sem,” which has been winning awards abroad since last year.
    When Iza Calzado started doing indie films around 2006, it was still rare to see mainstream actors crossing over, she noted. That’s why it was heartening for her to stand before a crowd composed of artists from both sides of the industry. After all, she stressed, the demarcation shouldn’t exist in the first place.
    “I just thought that they were the same thing—work is work, film is film. There’s no line,” said Iza, who won the Yakushi Pearl Award for best performer at the 12th Osaka Asian Film Festival for “Bliss.” “Now, we’re reaping the fruits of all the sacrifices made by our filmmakers back then.”
    Iza wasn’t afraid or embarrassed to admit that she had always dreamed of winning an international award.
    “I will not lie. I was praying about it. Come on! I’m happy I finally got it and, hopefully, it’s just the first of many,” she said.
    Baby Ruth Villarama and MJ Jacobo
    “I hope people see me as a person who represents our country well; as someone who was able to give joy, somehow.”
    Charo Santos-Concio, who got a special mention honor in acting for “Ang Babaeng Humayo” at the 17th Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Canary Islands, echoed Iza’s sentiments about erasing the notion that Philippine cinema is divided into “mainstream” and “indie.”
    “I’m in a business of producing what they call mainstream movies, but my heart will always have a soft spot for indie cinema. It’s where my roots are,” Charo said. “So, as long as I have the energy, I hope to blur the lines between indie and mainstream. There’s only one cinema.”
    The Indie Bravo! Awards was framed by exceptional performances by Celeste Legaspi, Rachel Alejandro and Sandino Martin, who rendered songs from two musicals-turned-movies.
    Celeste and Rachel opened the show with “Kay Sarap ng Buhay Nung Araw,” the theme song of “Ang Larawan,” an entry in this month’s Metro Manila Film Festival. Sandino concluded the two-hour program with “Maleta” from the Cinema One musical “Changing Partners.” —MARINEL R. CRUZ AND BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    The Woman Who Left” is back. After working with indie master Lav Diaz, Charo Santos-Concio will team up with another independent filmmaker, Mikhail Red, in a new thriller entitled “Eerie.” Sharing the screen with the ABS-CBN executive is the studio’s prized talent, Bea Alonzo.
    The young director behind the award-winning movie “Birdshot” told the Inquirer that he had gone to the Bucheon International Film Festival (Bifan), to pitch the project to foreign partners.
    “I thought I was taking the whole ‘Birdshot’ route again,” Red recalled.

    As luck would have it, he had a “chance encounter” with Star Cinema execs at the Bifan market. “They were there for the [Daniel Padilla-Kathryn Bernardo movie] ‘Barcelona: A Love Untold,’” he related. “Star Cinema liked the script and, luckily, we won the Bifan event.”

    He then pitched the movie to Charo and Bea, who both “loved their morally complex roles.”
    In the horror film, “Charo is cast as the Mother Superior, while Bea as the guidance counselor in an old conservative Catholic school where a murder takes place,” he said.
    “Mikhail is one of the country’s most promising young directors,” Santos told the Inquirer. “His past works have shown how much he knows film as a language. He seems to be in control of his material, of what he wants to say.”
    Yes, she has seen “Birdshot.” “I love it,” she enthused.
    She explained her attraction to the “Eerie” script: “What makes it interesting is that it’s a horror script, but it also tackles important issues about doctrine and science, faith and logic. It puts two complex characters who stand on opposite grounds.”
    Challenging role
    She described her role, Mother Alice, as “challenging.” “She believes that we should not allow the supernatural to be a part of our lives,” she said.

    She looks forward to working with Alonzo and she’s certain it will be a “wonderful experience.”
    “She has proven herself to be a natural, competent actress,” she said of Alonzo.
    “It is thrilling to see her doing something different. This is her first horror movie, after all,” she added. “I know that I will learn so much from her, and I hope to impart my experiences as an actress to her, as well.”
    Red explained: “It’s a new and exciting partnership between big stars, a big studio but with material from an independent filmmaker.”
    He recounted: “We went to Singapore recently where we networked for international sales. We want to make a film that can do well locally, but has substance and standards to be able to sell overseas.”
    Both Santos and Red agreed that this film marks a departure for both of them. “It’s something new and we have more things planned together … more surprises for local audiences who want something different but still entertaining,” clarified Red, adding that Star Cinema “has started to open up and aim for international distribution. They want to explore and make genre films that have the potential for export. I met them at the right time and right place.”

    “Jodilerks dela Cruz: Employee of the Month”
    Carlo Francisco Manatad’s “Jodilerks dela Cruz: Employee of the Month” won best short film in the Southeast Asian Short Film Competition of the 28th Singapore International Film Festival held recently at the Marina Bay Sands.
    The Filipino production bested 14 other short films in the section. The jury commended Manatad’s film for its “dark humor…[which] worked very well in showing the series of events that unfolded during a gas attendant’s last day at work.”
    The jurors elaborated that “the farcical approach in the storytelling was very effective in depicting the issues of lawlessness, crime and violence, affecting not only the country in question, but the world at large.”
    Surprise
    “The selection…was quite strong,” Manatad told the Inquirer. “So winning came as a surprise. But it also goes to show that the film has, one way or another, affected viewers and has made them perceive questions not only about the reality that is happening in our country, but across the world, as well.”
    An honoree in this year’s Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards, Manatad values this latest achievement. “It signifies that I am on the right track. Winning is a bonus; the main prize is seeing the people act and react to the film I’ve made. It gives me the proper validation and push to do more…and [aim for something] greater than what I am expected to do.”
    He has high hopes for these citations. “I wish that these awards will serve as inspiration to other young filmmakers, too.”
    The Singapore fest is described as “a celebration of Asian cinema and the recognition of a new wave of regional independent filmmakers.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    In its eight years, the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards has seen the full blossoming of the local independent filmmaking scene. But, of course, it didn’t just start eight years ago, or in 2005, when the paper’s Entertainment section first decided to vigorously champion the indie cause.
    Filmmaker Paolo Villaluna, in his first acceptance speech in 2010, dedicated the trophy to his mentors and inspirations because, he said, “we stand on the shoulders of giants.” (Villaluna is honored again this year for “Pauwi Na.”)
    First, a brief explanation on the name. Indie Bravo! is the title of this section’s regular feature that reports on the achievements of Filipino filmmakers in the international circuit. The reportage has never revolved around the validation given by foreigners, but has always been regarded as a celebration of Filipino artistry and talent.

    Atom Magadia, a first-time honoree this year for “Dagsin,” put it succinctly: “The Inquirer Indie Bravo! is a unique platform that celebrates the international accomplishments of Filipino filmmakers. To me, by virtue of its name, the award is a distinct honor which references the early triumphs of our nation’s revolutionary Founding Fathers abroad, particularly in the arts.”

    Like the Indios Bravos of the 19th century, this present generation’s artists are traveling to distant lands, to share the Filipino story—a narrative of resistance, a tale of struggle and hope.
    Magadia asserted: “As an indie filmmaker, this distinction inflames and impassions me to forge on, to gain new ground for our cinema and our unique Filipino stories beyond our shores!”
    Through the years, Inquirer Indie Bravo! has been evolving and expanding—like the filmmaking community itself.
    From directors (both veterans and neophytes), the honor roll has opened up to include actors and other members of the collective—a scriptwriter, producers, a music scorer, cinematographers and a costume designer.
    The citations, which are not competitive and are culled from the Indie Bravo! reports all-year-round, have also included not just full-length features, but also short films and documentaries. This year, there’s a live action-animated film (“Saving Sally”) on the roster.
    Rhian Ramos in “Saving Sally”
    Avid Liongoren, “Saving Sally” director, remarked: “As a first-time and small-time movie producer, I am immensely thankful for the support Indie Bravo! has given to our tiny little film.”
    Baby Ruth Villarama, who is awarded for the second time for “Sunday Beauty Queen,” related: “For someone trying to create documentary films in a country where there are so many real-life stories yet very little support [in marketing and distributing these films], the Inquirer Indie Bravo! award feels like a tap on the shoulder and an encouragement to carry on and move the dream forward. Nothing is sweeter than to escape to the movie theaters (or our home entertainment systems) and see the beautiful truth unfold on the big screen.”

    “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    Actress Iza Calzado, a first-time honoree for “Bliss,” pointed out: “In the United States, independently produced [movies] are distributed by big companies. My dream is for the masses to truly get and appreciate that which we call ‘indie’ … like ‘Smaller and Smaller Circles’ being appreciated by … Aling Tasing.”
    Iza Calzado in “Bliss”
    Calzado, who has been doing indie films for a decade (long before it became all the rage among actors), explained: “I’ve always valued cinema as cinema. My choices have often been material-driven. I always thought mainstream and indie were of the same value. It’s not the box office that I look at, but the role and film itself.”
    Actress Lotlot de Leon, a second-time recipient for “1st Sem,” volunteered: “It sounds like a cliché, but it is an honor and it really means a lot because I work hard and take my job seriously. To be recognized by the Inquirer … which gives the most unbiased and honest reviews, gives meaning to the word ‘deserving.’ And to stand alongside those who have given honor to our country through indie films!”
    Cannes-winning director Brillante Ma Mendoza, who is feted this year for “Ma’ Rosa,” told the Inquirer: “Nirerecognize ng Inquirer Indie Bravo! ang lahat ng Filipino filmmaker na nagbibigay ng karangalan sa ating bansa. Wala kasing maliit o malaki na karangalan. Ang karangalan ay iisa. Saludo ako at kaisa ng Inquirer sa pagbigay-halaga sa artistang Pilipino na patuloy sa paggawa ng makabuluhang pelikula sa buong mundo.”

    The Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards will be held at the newspaper’s main office in Makati on Monday, Dec. 11. The event can also be viewed live @inquirerdotnet on Facebook and Twitter and @inqpop on Facebook and Twitter. Updates will also be posted @InqEnt Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages.

    Actress Anna Luna considers herself fortunate that the real-life neophyte teacher she plays in the indie film “Maestra” was always present on the set.
    Apart from director Lemuel Lorca, Anna could always run to board-topping teacher Iah Seraspi whenever she had a question. “I often asked Iah if what was written in the script actually happened to her,” Anna recalled.
    Iah would invariably confirm that the travails recounted in the screenplay by Archie del Mundo were based on real incidents.

    Some of those hardships, Anna got to experience first-hand, like walking under the noonday sun for four hours to reach a school in a remote village. “In one scene, Iah had nothing but fish crackers with rice for dinner,” Anna related. “Iah told me that that had happened before. So I tried it myself. It was delicious naman.”

    Anna feels strongly that other young people like her should watch “Maestra,” which opens in SM Cinemas on Dec. 8 as part of Cine Lokal, so that they would be more appreciative of their blessings.
    Millennials, Anna explained, could be a tad spoiled. “They have things easy and yet remain unsatisfied. They should learn from people like Iah, who never gave up in pursuing her dreams.”
    “Maestra”—which tells the stories of three generations of mentors, the newbie (Anna), the Aeta (Angeli Bayani) and the retiree (Gloria Sevilla)—depicts the quiet fortitude of public school teachers.
    Producer Carl Balita pointed out that the movie’s protagonists were inspired by real-life women whom he had met in his review centers.
    “They’re all admirable. We want to celebrate the heroism of teachers,” said the producer. “This movie is our humble tribute to them for their immense contributions to our society.”
    Direk Lem was just as impressed with the actresses who portrayed these unsung heroines.
    “Tita Glo is amazing. She has incredible screen presence, and her memory remains as sharp as ever,” Direk Lem noted. “Angeli has become a favorite ever since I directed her in ‘Ned’s Project.’ While I’ve known Anna since she was a kid. Her father Rommel was my classmate at the Mowelfund Institute.”

    Anna, who won best actress at the Five Continents Film Festival in Venezuela for “Maestra,” is keenly aware of the sacrifices that the teaching profession demands of its practitioners. “My grandmother was a teacher,” Anna volunteered. “I also asked around. I have friends who are preschool teachers. Of course, I always turned to Iah for help.”
    Anna said she tried her best to embody Iah’s dedication onscreen. “The only things I wasn’t able to copy were her voluptuous figure … and her intelligence!”
    Iah graduated cum laude at a university in her home province of Romblon, the producer remarked. “But her relatives kept discouraging her from teaching, because there was no money in it.”
    Iah, however, persevered “because she considers education her vocation, her mission in life.”

    Respected names in Philippine show biz and literature gathered to support the premiere of Raya Martin’s latest film, “Smaller and Smaller Circles.”
    Led by TBA Studios’ executive producer Fernando Ortigas and president Vincent Nebrida, the premiere was held at Greenhills Promenade Mall Cinema 6 and 7 on Dec. 2. The movie is the film adaptation of FH Batacan’s acclaimed crime novel.

    Ruby Ruiz in “Imago”
    Raymund Ribay Gutierrez’s short film “Imago” won best director at the 35th Sulmona International Film Festival in Italy, from Nov. 8 to 12.
    According to the fest’s website, Gutierrez builds on “the legacy” of his mentor, “maestro Brillante Ma Mendoza, [but] with a significant personal touch.” The jury commends Gutierrez whose “distinctive mis-en-scène approaches a controversial topic with remarkable tension and courage.”
    Gutierrez told the Inquirer: “It feels great to be recognized internationally … for bringing Philippine culture across the world.”
    “Imago” chronicles the struggles of a funeral parlor agent, who’s also a single mom to a child with Down syndrome.

    Filipino producer Darlene Catly Malimas reports that Andrea Capranico’s documentary, “The Landscape Within,” won the Jury Award for Best Picture at the recent Experimental Forum Los Angeles.

    Matt Daclan in Busan
    For actor Matt Daclan, playing a transgender woman in Gerardo Calagui’s “Mga Gabing Kasinghaba ng Buhok Ko” (Those Long-haired Nights) was both physically and emotionally harrowing.
    For starters, wearing three-inch heels left bruises on his feet. More painfully, he had to endure a full-body wax treatment, to remove unsightly hair.
    He also dropped 10 pounds to look “fragile and dainty.”

    To top it off, he had to tuck his privates between his legs throughout the shoot. “Fortunately, the 12- to 14-hour work schedule had just been implemented,” Daclan recounted. It could’ve been longer, a morning-to-morning shoot!

    Still, going to the loo was tricky because it would mean removing not just his undies and leggings, but also unraveling his family jewels.
    Matt Daclan in “Mga Gabing Kasinghaba ng Buhok Ko”
    “So I just avoided peeing,” Daclan recalled.
    Needless to say, Daclan and his fellow actors, Anthony Falcon and Rocky Salumbides, went to great lengths, in order to play cross-dressing sex workers.
    Unlike previous films that tapped real-life trans women, Calagui chose heterosexual men as his lead stars.
    “We originally wanted to cast the actual transgenders of Burgos (the red-light district of Makati), the same people we had interviewed in writing the script,” the debuting director volunteered. “But they were hesitant, because they didn’t want to jeopardize their work.”
    Focusing on the travails of three real-life transgenders was also Calagui’s Plan B. “We initially set out to do a film on the Jennifer Laude case,” he related.
    A trans woman, Laude died in the hands of an American soldier three years ago. “But since the case was ongoing at that time, there were certain legal impediments. Our script consultant Armando Lao suggested the stories of the transgender women of Burgos, instead.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    To prepare for their roles, Daclan, Falcon and Salumbides “immersed” themselves in the nightlife of the rowdy district. “For weeks, they would go to Burgos in drag and sometimes they would get propositioned by foreigners.”
    As an actor, Daclan was changed by the experience of portraying a transgender.
    “I no longer look at them the same way. I admire them. They have to face discrimination, and sometimes danger from sadistic clients, every night. Still, they would do everything for their family,” Daclan pointed out.
    Calagui reported that his movie will be shown in seven festivals before the end of 2017.
    First stop is Busan (Oct. 12 to 21), where it is vying for the Kim Jiseok Award. Also this month, Calagui’s film is the lone Filipino entry, competing in the Rainbow section of QCinema (Oct. 19 to 28).
    Then, it will compete in the Thessaloniki fest (Nov. 2 to 12) in Greece. “It will also be screened in Hawaii (Nov. 2 to 12), San Diego (Nov. 9 to 18), the Cinematografo Originals in San Francisco (Nov. 9 to 12) and the Golden Horse fest in Taipei (Nov. 3 to 24).”
    Calagui feels strongly about sharing this film with the whole world. “This is not just a transgender’s story. This is also my story. I’m a proud member of the LGBT community. It’s a story from the heart,” Calagui said.

    Palacio told the Inquirer that the San Sebastián journey was “rewarding.” He explained that the film was not just about Filipinos who “live in a cemetery … it’s about the homeless, the outcast, the neglected.”
    He dedicated the award to marginalized people in society. “In San Sebastián, their voices were heard.

    He expressed elation that his film had succeeded in telling its harrowing story to a global audience. The screenings were packed, he recalled. “I kept hearing people sniffling in the theater. Some viewers cried. I couldn’t blame them because I also got teary-eyed watching it.”

    He recounted that the mostly foreign audience had asked numerous questions about the shoot. “They were very curious … They wondered if we had used hidden cameras because the acting of Joem Bascon and Mara Lopez was so realistic.”
    “It’s fulfilling that the audience heard and understood the film’s message,” Palacios pointed out. “Beyond the glitz and glamour, we had a mission in Spain. And with the turnout … we are on our way to accomplishing it.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Raymond Bagatsing as Nick Joaquin in “Dahling Nick”
    Films on the martial-law era will be shown abroad in San Francisco and New York, United States, and locally in Quezon City, this month.
    Apart from Sari Dalena’s “Dahling Nick” (which will be screened today), Keith Sicat’s “Komikero Chronicles” will also be presented at the 4th Filipino-American International Book Festival in San Francisco on Oct. 7. Sicat explains that “Dahling Nick” (which tackles the life of National Artist Nick Joaquin) and “Komikero Chronicles” (which recounts the history of komiks in the Philippines) are “films that examine the effects of martial law on the literary sphere.”
    Meanwhile, Dalena and Sicat’s documentary “History of the Underground” will be shown at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City, on Oct. 7 as well. The docu took seven years to make and focused on the struggles of activists, intellectuals and revolutionary leaders in the 1970s.

    Meanwhile, Shallah Montero’s short film, “Papa’s Shadows,” is competing in the 2nd Slemani International Film Festival, ongoing in Iraqi Kurdistan until Oct. 7.
    “Papa’s Shadows”
    An alumna of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, Montero counts visual artist/puppeteer Don Salubayba and cinematographer Egay Navarro as her mentors.
    “Don introduced me to shadow plays, while a conversation with Egay’s little son on death inspired me to write this story,” Montero recalled. The short film centers on a young girl who grapples with the concept of death, after the passing of her father.
    Montero’s film shows that “children’s imagination can help them cope and their innocence can push them to become stronger” in spite of life’s harsh realities.
    Montero told the Inquirer that she’s not expecting to win a prize because “to have my film shown in the fest is a victory already.”
    “My true goal is for more people, from different places and from all walks of life, to watch my film,” she explained. “I hope it speaks to the people in that region, especially those who have experienced loss. Despite different cultures, human emotion is what we have in common…”

    “Papa’s Shadows” won the Netpac Jury Prize in the short films section of the QCinema fest last year.
    Located in southern Kurdistan, Slemani or Sulaymaniyah is known as “the city of culture.” The Slemani fest also presents full-length and short films from the Kurdistan region: Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.

    Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo
    The production value of “Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral” will be double that of its prequel, “Heneral Luna,” according to Mon Confiado.
    Mon, who plays Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo in “Goyo,” revealed that the film’s production team will be working for 60 days, as compared to the 32 days it took to finish “Luna.”
    “There are big scenes that sometimes require 500 people to make,” Mon said when Inquirer asked him for updates on the historical film by Jerrold Tarog.

    Paulo Avelino will play the lead character, Gen. Gregorio del Pilar. Epy Quizon is still Apolinario Mabini, Alvin Anson is Gen. Jose Alejandrino, Benjamin Alves is Pres. Manuel L.

    “In relation to Aguinaldo, in this film, the audience will ask whether he’s a hero or a traitor. Of course, there are always two sides to a story,” Mon pointed out.
    Prodded more by the Inquirer, Mon relented that Paulo “is perfect for the role of Goyo. History says that the character is a ladies’ man. He has girlfriends in every province.
    “He is also Aguinaldo’s favorite,” Mon said of Del Pilar. “The audience will question his loyalty to Aguinaldo: Is he following Aguinaldo’s orders because he believes that the latter is a good leader, or is it just because Aguinaldo is his idol?”
    Mon, who has almost 300 acting projects under his belt, admitted that the role is his biggest break, so far.
    The actor added: “While it has its advantages, it also has its downside. I’m pressured to make sure the audience will not see Aguinaldo in the other characters I’ll portray in the future. It’s my most challenging role to date.”

    Five Filipino films will be showcased at the 30th Tokyo International Film Festival in Japan, from Oct. 25 to Nov. 3.
    Two Filipino films are competing in the Tokyo fest’s Asian Future section. Loy Arcenas’ big-screen musical adaptation of Nick Joaquin’s “Ang Larawan” (The Portrait) will make its world premiere at the Tokyo fest as part of the Asian Future section. The fest’s website describes Arcenas’ film as “a romantic family-themed musical with brilliant singing by world-renowned stars.”
    Joanna Ampil, who played Kim in the West End production of “Miss Saigon,” topbills “Ang Larawan,” along with Rachel Alejandro and Paulo Avelino.

    Making its international premiere in the Asian Future section is Arnel Arbi Barbarona’s “Tu Pug Imatuy” (The Right to Kill). The Tokyo fest’s website calls Barbarona’s film “a tense, multi-award-winning” work.

    “Tu Pug Imatuy” won best picture at this year’s Sinag Maynila Film Festival, which is spearheaded by Cannes-winning Filipino director Brillante Ma Mendoza.
    Daniel Palacio’s “Pailalim” (Underground), which is produced by Mendoza, is included in the World Focus section. The Tokyo fest’s website sums up Palacio’s film as “a family drama that bridges the gap between the living and the dead.”
    “Tu Pug Imatuy”
    According to the site, “Pailalim,” which debuted at this year’s San Sebastián fest, is “a story of struggle, survival and love in a place nobody could call home.” Palacio’s film will be having its Asian premiere at the Tokyo fest.
    Another Sinag Maynila film, HF Yambao’s “Kristo,” is featured in the Crosscut Asia: What’s Next Southeast Asia? program. Yambao’s movie centers on the struggles of a cockfight bet collector who moonlights as a market vendor. The Crosscut Asia section includes films chosen by different screen luminaries from the region and Mendoza recommended “Kristo” to the fest.
    Mendoza is slated to give a master class on the topic, “working with actors,” at the fest on Oct. 26. The Tokyo event’s website commends Mendoza for “leading Filipino cinema into its ripe Third Golden Age.”
    A cinematic gem from the Second Golden Age of Philippine cinema, the restored version of Mike de Leon’s 1980 musical-comedy “Kakabakaba Ka Ba?” (Will Your Heart Beat Faster?), will be shown in the Discovering Asian Cinema program of the Crosscut Asia section.
    The president of this year’s main competition jury is Oscar-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones. A special retrospective on the works of Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh will also be mounted this year.

    I feel more comfortable doing complicated dance moves than making sure I hit the right notes Shaina Magdayao Actress
    I’ve never prayed so hard in my life as I did while doing this,” said actress Shaina Magdayao when asked to recall her experience working on the latest Lav Diaz film, “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw” (The Season of the Devil).
    The movie, which was described to Shaina by producer Bianca Balbuena as “an antimusical musical, a rock opera,” was shot entirely in Malaysia. Shaina plays a singer.
    “I hate singing. I honestly don’t feel as confident as when I’m dancing. I feel more comfortable doing complicated dance moves and death-defying flips rather than making sure I hit the right notes when singing,” the 27-year-old actress confessed.

    This came as a revelation since Shaina is the youngest sister of singer-actress Vina Morales. Their dad, Ike Magdayao, a former band vocalist, taught Shaina how to sing when she was 4 years old.

    “When we were shooting, I didn’t have time for voice lessons because I was still working on (the ABS-CBN drama) ‘The Better Half.’ I tape for the series three times a week and during weekends, I fly to Malaysia for this. I prayed hard that I’d meet Direk Lav’s expectations,” Shaina recalled.
    The actress added: “I only realized how effective an actress I was when I faced the camera [as a singer]. Even though I was feeling so nervous, I was able to pull it off. I kept thinking, Direk Lav wouldn’t cast me for the film if he didn’t see my potential.”
    She said the entire cast would be singing throughout the movie. “It’s very interesting. I think it’s the first Filipino film of its kind,” she beamed. “Before this, all I’ve wanted was to work with Lav Diaz—and it’s finally happened!”
    She recently announced on Instagram that she’d be part of yet another Diaz creation—“Ang Saka ni Henrico” (Henrico’s Farm), starring Charo Santos.
    The actress hasn’t informed her dad of her role in “Ang Panahon ng Halimaw.” “I’m sure he will be so happy the moment he hears me sing. He’s really the singer in the family, and he knows how I hate singing,” Shaina pointed out. “But, for the moviegoers, I’m sure it will be awesome.”
    Meanwhile, Shaina said the Magdayao family also has another reason to celebrate this month—it’s the 19th anniversary of Ystilo Salon, which now has 25 branches nationwide.

    Filipino filmmakers won big at the recent 10th Festival Angaelica, held in Big Bear Lake, California.
    Dexter Hemedez and Allan Michael Ibañez’s “1st Sem” won the top prize, for best international feature.
    E del Mundo bagged the best cinematography award for the short film, “Manong ng Pa-aling.” Marie Jamora’s “Flip the Record” scored the best short narrative at the fest. Gino Jose’s “Waivers,” which topbills Cai Cortez, brought home the best storytelling prize for short films. Jose’s other short film, “Basaan,” was shown at the fest, as well.

    “It is amazing that numerous artists are curious about the state of filmmaking in our country,” Ibañez told the Inquirer. “We are proud that other Filipino filmmakers won in the fest.”
    “We’re grateful for the recognition,” Hemedez related. “The organizers, led by [actress-producer] Breven Angaelica Warren, said the group’s main goal was to promote quality independent films.”
    Hemedez remarked that the organizers left no stone unturned, devoting their personal resources to ensure the festival’s success. “They don’t know how they will be able to recoup their investment, but they believe in supporting deserving films … that inspire us to work harder.”
    The festival is “unique and unconventional,” Hemedez pointed out. “There’s camping, outdoor screenings and other activities involving nature. The experience was personal and intimate.”
    Ibañez recounted: “We also attended workshops on different aspects of filmmaking. It allowed us to connect to different filmmakers from all over the world. We got to share stories on our struggles in creating, distributing and marketing our films.”
    Hemedez noted that the fest “opened another perspective on how films could be seen and how festivals could be mounted.”
    According to its website, Festival Angaelica is a film and arts festival that showcases the works of filmmakers from the United States and around the globe.
    Next stop for the CineFilipino movie was the Buffalo Niagara Film Festival in New York.

    This time, the honor comes with monetary incentive.
    Avid Liongoren’s “Saving Sally” won the Jury’s Special Award at the 21st Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival (Sicaf), held recently in South Korea.
    Liongoren happily reports that the award includes a cash prize. “Usually when you win…

    Liongoren tells the Inquirer that the victory is indeed a cause for celebration: “Nakakaaliw. Pang-shawarma party din!” The total reward is one million won (roughly P45,000). “I am a millionaire in Korea! It’s not huge, but it’s unexpected… [making it] sweeter.”
    The filmmaker explains that competition was stiff in the fest. “It’s significant because the other entries were malulupit [fierce]. [To think,] ang low-fi ng banat namin.”
    “Even if the other films were more refined, the jurors saw something special with what we did,” he explains. “Early on, when we were making the movie, we knew that we couldn’t compete on the Pixar level. So, we went the other direction, to avoid comparisons.”
    Liongoren remarks that it’s heartening that accomplished animators have found his movie beautiful and award-worthy. “Nakakatuwa!”
    An entry in last year’s Metro Manila Film Festival, “Saving Sally” combines live action and computer animation and topbills Rhian Ramos, Enzo Marcos and TJ Trinidad.
    Liongoren’s film previously won top awards at the Fantasporto fest in Portugal, the Brussels Fantastic Fest in Belgium, and the Los Angeles Asia-Pacific and Bentonville fests in the United States.
    Established in 1995, the Sicaf supports “great possibilities in combining new technology with cartoon and animation.”

    This year’s theme is “Adventure with Sicaf,” promoting the event as “an experience-oriented and communicative festival.”

    Roderick Cabrido’s “Purgatoryo” was invited to four film festivals in Europe recently.
    First stop for the QCinema movie was the 14th Jameson CineFest Miskolc International Film Festival, which ran until Sept. 17 in Hungary. The Miskolc fest aims “to bring the freshest and most outstanding” films to Central Europe.
    Cabrido’s film was also part of the Next Door section of the 22nd Split International Festival of New Film, held recently in Croatia.

    Its program consists of products of the world’s best festivals.
    “Purgatoryo” also vied for the top prize at the recent 23rd L’Etrange Festival, held in Paris, France.
    The Paris fest, which features filmmakers “seeking new paths,” awarded two honors: the Grand Prix and the Audience Award.
    The fest’s website describes Cabrido’s work “as a new bomb from the Philippines,” which comes quick on the heels of Khavn de la Cruz’s films (“Alipato,” “Ruined Heart”), which were earlier shown in the same event.
    The fest’s website hails Cabrido as “a rising star in Southeast Asian cinema” and “Purgatoryo” as “sumptuous… [proving that] genre movies can be at once social, intelligent, original and damned efficient.”
    Highlight of the Filipino film’s European tour is the 50th Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival in Catalonia, Spain, from Oct. 5 to 15.
    Sitges is widely regarded as “one of the world’s foremost international festivals specializing in fantasy and horror films.”

    According to the fest’s website, Cabrido’s film, which will compete in the Noves Vision Plus Inauguration section, “evokes Dante’s purgatory.”
    The section focuses on films that “delve into new formal, conceptual and narrative channels.”
    Cabrido told the Inquirer: “To be chosen by these festivals is a big honor and privilege. It will promote not only our film, but the country, as well.”

    Two Filipino movies are included in the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, ongoing until Sept. 24.
    After its screening on Sept. 10, Jay Altarejos’ “Tale of the Lost Boys” will have another showing on Sept. 24 as part of the HK fest’s Special Presentation program. Topbilled by Oliver Aquino and Ta Su, the Philippine-Taiwanese production tells the story of two men who “form new perspectives on their identities.”
    “It’s essential to screen this film in Hong Kong because it is of great importance to connect with our neighbors, to know what are the issues that affect us and to see the similarities in our cultures,” Altarejos told the Inquirer.

    “And it’s really about time that the region’s artists cross borders to share their talent,” he added.

    Altarejos related that the next stop for his movie is the Shanghai Queer Film Festival (from Sept. 16 to 24).
    Also part of the HK fest’s Asia Focus section is Petersen Vargas’ “2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten.” The award-winning Cinema One film—which features Khalil Ramos, Ethan Salvador and Jameson Blake—will have screenings on Sept. 16 and 23.
    Vargas told the Inquirer: “I like the fact that our next international screening is in Asia, in the long-running HK LGBT fest.”
    He pointed out that it’s “important to keep surveying the way the LGBT community fights for equality and acceptance, even through the movies we watch and make. Festivals as strong and determined as the HK event can help shape perspectives, especially among the new breed, to extend the [struggle] back home.”
    Founded in 1989, the HK fest is reputedly the oldest cinema event for the LGBT community in the region.
    The fest’s organizers “seek to promote equal opportunities and eliminate discrimination against sexual minority groups in Hong Kong through cinematic works of art.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    Three documentaries on the Philippines are part of the FreedomFilmFest, ongoing at the JLN University, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia until tomorrow.
    Included in the festival are Baby Ruth Villarama’s “Sunday Beauty Queen,” Michael Collins and Marty Syjuco’s “Give Up Tomorrow” and Bryan Kristoffer J. Brazil’s “Sa Kalagitnaan ng Gabi.”
    “Sunday Beauty Queen” tackles the travails of Filipino domestic helpers who mount a pageant on their day-off in Hong Kong. “Give Up Tomorrow” follows the complicated case of Paco Larrañaga, who is accused of the rape and murder of two Cebuano girls. “Sa Kalagitnaan ng Gabi” dissects President Duterte’s war on drugs and its impact on human rights in the Philippines.

    The event is spearheaded by the Freedom Film Network (FFN), “a nonprofit body established to support and develop social documentary filmmaking within the context of freedom of expression and the values contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”

    Mary Joy Apostol in “Birdshot”
    Mikhail Red’s “Birdshot” continues to fly all over the world. Next stop for the Filipino movie is the Adelaide Film Festival in Australia, from Oct. 5 to 15.
    Producer Pamela Reyes related that “Birdshot” will have two screenings at the fest: on Oct. 10 at the Mercury Cinema and on Oct. 13 at the GU Film House Adelaide.
    According to the fest’s website, the biennial event is “one of the boldest and most innovative in Australia” and has established itself as a “platform for new talent.”

    “It’s exciting,” Red told the Inquirer. “It’s another continental premiere for our film. Plus, it’s in the main competition.”
    Red hopes to attend the fest, especially since he has family in Adelaide.
    “I am so happy that the film continues to travel even after its local run.”
    The film, he said, “has opened a lot of doors … I am so proud of this film and the talented team behind it.”
    He noted that it “showcases the diversity of Philippine cinema.”
    Red said he only has two blank pages left in his passport and “we still have a few festivals booked until mid-2018.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz was chosen as one of the jurors of the New Currents section of the 22nd Busan International Film Festival in South Korea, from Oct. 12 to 21.

    Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards,” which topbills Pepe Smith as a grizzled rocker, will compete in the 15th International Film Festival of Asian-Pacific Countries in Vladivostok, set in Russia, from Sept. 9 to 15.

    Every year, 200 films are screened in the Vladivostok fest’s different venues.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Gina Alajar in “Madilim ang Gabi”
    Adolfo Alix Jr.’s “Madilim ang Gabi” (Dark Is the Night) is set to have its world premiere at the 42nd Toronto International Film Festival, to be held in Canada from Sept. 7 to 17.
    Alix told the Inquirer that “Madilim ang Gabi” is his 30th feature film. For this special project, Alix gathered actors whom he had collaborated with in previous films. Leading the cast are Gina Alajar, Phillip Salvador, Bembol Roco and Felix Roco. Also in the movie are some of Alix’s regular cast members: Anita Linda, Perla Bautista, Elizabeth Oropesa, Rosanna Roces, Cherry Pie Picache, Angel Aquino, Alessandra de Rossi, Iza Calzado, Sid Lucero, Jason Abalos, Zanjoe Marudo and Cherie Gil.
    The shoot was a reunion for these Alix actors. “All of us did this film for the love of Adolf,” Alajar related. “He is such a lovable guy. He’s easy to get along with. No drama. No angst. That was why everyone was ready and willing to work with him.”

    Mary Joy Apostol in “Birdshot”
    From the get-go, young filmmaker Mikhail Red wanted to veer away from the same path taken by his contemporaries. After all, the current glut of festivals on the local scene can be both a blessing and a curse.
    “I am proud to be part of this generation of filmmakers,” Red explained. “There are many opportunities for us … there are many local festivals that give out grants that allow us to make our dream movies.”
    But it’s also easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle, Red conceded. “At the same time, the challenge for you, as a filmmaker, is to stand out from the crowd.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    With his second feature film, “Birdshot,” he sought to break free from tried-and-tested practices. “We looked for a different route. If you join a local festival, you are locked in and under obligation to finish a film at a certain time.”

    In any case, he remarked, he had already experienced the “boot-camp,” baptism-of-fire method, in his debut feature, the Cinemalaya entry “Rekorder” in 2013.
    For “Rekorder,” they often had to shoot round the clock. “We packed up the next day. We shot for 27 hours,” producer Pamela Reyes looked back.
    “This time, we wanted sensible working hours, fair talent fees and the right equipment, too,” Red volunteered.
    The secret turned out to be simple and complicated, because it entailed having the courage and wherewithal to “pitch” your script to various agencies, foreign and local.
    “We went around … looking for funding and found it in Qatar (Doha Film Institute), South Korea (CJ Entertainment) and France and Thailand (Produire au Sud),” Red recalled.
    Apart from Red’s PelikulaRed, TBA Studios, the team behind “Heneral Luna,” also got in as majority producer. CJ Entertainment awarded “Birdshot” with a prize in Busan, while Produire au Sud gave study grants to Red and Reyes.
    Its local distributor is Solar Entertainment, while Globe (yes, the telecom company) is on board as the marketing arm. It really takes a global village to create a film these days.

    “While attending different pitching fora, you’re able to garner attention for your project even before filming begins,” Red related. “So some festival programmers are already waiting for you by the time you’re done.”
    “Birdshot” won best film in the Asian Future section of last year’s Tokyo fest. It premiered at the Cinemalaya last week and will have its local run, as part of Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino, from Aug. 16-22.
    As coup de grace, “Birdshot” recently earned a rave review from industry bible, Variety.
    In an essay published on Aug. 7, Variety critic Richard Kuipers described Red’s sophomore outing as a “gripping combination of police procedural and coming-of-age drama … a compelling study in the loss of innocence while … offering potent commentary on the state of things in the Philippines.”
    Kuipers hailed the film as “wonderfully directed and performed,” singling out neophyte Mary Joy Apostol for her “magnetic screen presence” and for holding her own “in the company of reliable pros, Arnold Reyes and John Arcilla.”
    “We’re very proud that we got strong reviews from reputable sources like Variety and Screen International,” Red told the Inquirer.
    Red reported that he had just accepted invites to join five international festivals. “We are booked until 2018!” he disclosed.

    You know something is amiss when you watch five consecutive Cinemalaya entries, and each of them ends up becoming a painful viewing experience. No, they aren’t just mediocre—they’re either contrived, predictable or migraine-inducing for their astonishing lapses in craft and logic. An “all-time low,” as a friend and colleague succinctly noted.
    That was how our moviegoing marathon unraveled last weekend. And the fact that those films were being fielded by the country’s premier indie festival—responsible for such delectable cinematic gems as “Quick Change,” “Mariquina,” “Bwakaw”   and “Pamilya Ordinaryo”—was quite troubling.
    We’ve always championed Cinemalaya’s cause since its auspicious start in 2005, but blind patronage has never been our cup of tea. The big question is, who dropped the ball?

    When the dust finally settled, we could recommend only three of the festival’s nine official entries in the full-length feature category: Alberto Monteras II’s “Respeto,” Mes de Guzman’s “Ang Pamilyang Hindi Lumuluha” and Thop Nazareno’s “Kiko Boksingero.”

    Using the country’s disheartening human-rights situation to frame its tale, “Respeto” examines the unlikely bond forged between amateur rapper Hendrix (Abra) and martial law poet “Doc” Fortunato Reyes (Dido dela Paz), who find comfort in their shared love for spoken word.
    As entertaining as it is thematically pertinent, Monteras’ urgently paced film blurs the line between poetry and rap music with insightful boldness. But the movie, Cinemalaya’s most significant entry this year, wouldn’t have been as convincing without the award-worthy turns of the charismatic Abra and Dela Paz. Similarly outstanding are supporting actors Chai Fonacier, Loonie and the sinister Nor Domingo.
    At 76 minutes, the bittersweet coming-of-age drama “Kiko Boksingero” is the fest’s shortest and most poignant film: When his mother passes away, 11-year-old  Kiko (Noel Comia Jr.) is left to the care of his doting nanny (Yayo Aguila).

    Kiko’s humdrum existence gets a shot of adrenaline when he crosses paths with retired boxer George (Yul Servo)—who happens to be his estranged father. But, it is the boy’s relationship with his yaya where the film finds its heart.
    With its no-frills storytelling style, the movie cleverly does away with distracting narrative side trips. But, its brevity is also its own limitation, because it leaves not much room for character development or backstories that could have made its story richer, fuller and more empathetic.
    Lending understated charm to their roles are Comia and Aguila, who vivify a heartwarming relationship that persuasively demonstrates why people don’t have to be blood relatives to genuinely care for each other.
    Completing the film’s thespic tag team is Servo, who limns the fascinating contradictions of his appealing but flawed character with uncomplicated grace.

    Also devoid of unnecessary convolutions is Mes de Guzman’s “Ang Pamilyang Hindi Lumuluha,” which is as much a showcase for the director’s versatility as it is for Sharon Cuneta’s continually maturing and award-worthy “dramedic” chops. The film is De Guzman’s most accessible film to date.
    Like “Kiko,” “Pamilya” astutely demonstrates why “less is more.” It doesn’t veer far away from its deceptively simple premise but, as with the rest of De Guzman’s oeuvre (“Diablo,” “Ang Kwento ni Mabuti”), there’s more to it than meets the eye.
    Staged with prescient precision and a tantalizing serving of magic realism, “Pamilya” plays out like a fable following the tale of lonely and desperate  Cora dela Cruz (Cuneta).
    With her kooky maid (the spunky Moi Bien) by her side, Cora seeks out the help of an “investigator” (Niño Muhlach) to find the mythical “Family That Doesn’t Weep”—who, she believes, can bring back the husband, son and daughter who have all abandoned her!
    With disarming persuasiveness, the film questions people’s proclivity for relying on others to bring them happiness.

    It also shows why Sharon deserves to win Cinemalaya’s best actress award—in a role that plays well to her strengths as an actress. Doing comedy may look like a breeze because it doesn’t require showy caterwauling, but executing it well is always a tough thespic roe to hoe.
    The Megastar seamlessly juggles the movie’s rollicking moments with the eventual dramatic catharsis that explodes when her character reaches the end of her rope.
    “Pamilya” and “Boksingero” prove that a film doesn’t need circuitous detours to tell a fascinating story.
    In instructive contrast, Angeli Bayani is consistently transfixing in Zig Dulay’s “Bagahe,” where she’s cast as an overseas worker accused of attempted parricide. But hers is a  portrayal we’ve already seen in “Bwaya”—and one that’s weighed down by a frustratingly predictable film.
    In it, every scene feels like it’s been set up to give Bayani a “watch-and-learn” opportunity to play the “victim card” to the hilt—which eventually feels disingenuous and exhausting.
    To be honest, we were looking forward to watching “Bagahe” because, while 2011’s “Huling Halik” was wince-worthy for its exploitative  theme and tone, Dulay’s follow-ups (“Paglipay,” “Bambanti”) were proficiently helmed  dramas.
    Sadly, “Bagahe” struggles to find its feet as it repurposes tragedy to excuse its clichés. So, what happened?
    For its part, Nerissa Picadizo’s romantic travelogue, “Requited,” generates more fizzle than sparks. It is compromised further by a silly twist.
    In the movie, ailing biker Matt (the intense Jake Cuenca) embarks on his “final adventure” to Mt. Pinatubo, with Sandy (Anna Luna, who’s grossly miscast) in tow.
    As “friends” who can’t seem to stop bickering long enough to realize their abiding love for each other, Matt and Sandy prefer to complicate an otherwise uncomplicated situation.
    Joseph Israel Laban’s “Baconaua” is as problematic for its soporific, meandering development as it is for its cast’s knee-jerk characterizations.
    As it shows how the residents of a fishing village react to an “astonishing sight of a sea that has turned red,” the movie for much of its running time (at Greenbelt) is too dark to appreciate—which is a big no-no in a visual medium like film. But, the languorous story itself doesn’t amount to much because of its stodgy execution.
    In the case of Iar Lionel Arondaing’s “Sa Gabing Nananahimik ang mga Kuliglig,” its visual inventiveness hardly provides relief for its ponderous exposition and the protagonists’ slowly shifting circumstances.
    In fact, it takes distraught Magda (Angel Aquino) and her confessor Father Romi (Jake Macapagal) 15 minutes to “introduce” the movie’s premise as they tattle and prattle about sin, culpability, redemption and the inviolability of the seal of confession.
    The movie examines the events surrounding the death of Magda’s best friend, Dolores (Mercedes Cabral). But, even without its moody proselytizing, there are loose ends that need tying up.
    When Dolores’ husband (Ricky Davao) is asked about their union, he reveals that they’ve been married for more than 20 years. It makes viewers wonder how old Cabral’s character was when she married Davao—5 years old? It’s illogical lapses like this that hobbles the film’s believability.
    Fraught with tedious clichés, Sonny Calvento’s “Nabubulok” has trouble settling into a coherent story.
    In it, the unexplained disappearance of a Filipina who’s married to an American expat creates a ruckus in a village. But, the film quickly succumbs to a series of ridiculous events that utilizes frenetic pacing as an excuse for its inability to find a clarifying focus for its story.
    As it dramatizes the needlessness of war, Perry Escaño’s advocacy film, “Ang Guro Kong Di Marunong Magbasa,” whisks viewers through a checklist of filmmaking clichés.
    It tells how illiterate Aaquil (Alfred Vargas) manages to pass himself off as a teacher in his war-torn community.
    The protracted production cooks up a cinematic brew that has everything—melodrama, action, nerve-bursting performances, etc.—except a comprehensible story.
    The film means well but, as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

    True to their legacy of telling bolder stories, the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival continues their screening for this year’s entries, which will run until Aug. 13 at various venues of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) and Ayala Cinemas.
    “We expect films that will tell their stories from a place of truth, so that the work reflects life itself; films that tell their stories with artistic integrity, so that they reveal the filmmakers’ true spirit,” Cinemalaya competition chair Laurice Guillen said during her speech at the 13th Cinemalaya opening night.
    “I guess you could say that this is what we should expect to see when we watch the finished films at the festival. Our shared viewing experience will be the richer for it; and our conversations and discussions over coffee will be all the more stimulating, relevant, productive and enlightening,” Guillen said.

    Scene from “Alipato”
    Khavn dela Cruz’s latest film, “Alipato: The Very Brief Life of an Ember,” had its Philippine premiere yesterday at the Tanghalang Huseng Batute of the Cultural Center of the Philippines on the first day of the Cinemalaya indie film festival.
    After Cinemalaya, “Alipato” will have screenings at the 66th Melbourne International Film Festival in Australia on Aug. 11 and 18.
    The Melbourne fest, which runs until Aug. 20, describes the Filipino film as a “neon-lit dystopia bursting with child gangsters, surreal violence, karaoke and goat-cam.”

    The futuristic film follows a “hell-raising” gang of orphans in the middle of a crime spree.

    Alessandra de Rossi (right) and Empoy Marquez in “Kita Kita”
    Stop the press: Kumita ang “Kita Kita.”
    The success of her latest movie, “Kita Kita,” came as a shocker to director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo, an Inquirer Indie Bravo! honoree for her internationally acclaimed CineFilipino debut film, “Ang Huling Cha-Cha ni Anita.”
    “I was really surprised,” she told the Inquirer. “But I was more stunned by the good reviews. Even those who are not from the film industry suddenly became critics. It’s heartening that there is discussion [about it]. That people are dissecting the story and analyzing why they liked the movie.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Small movies that don’t boast marquee names usually get yanked out of theaters before the weekend. That wasn’t the case for “Kita Kita,” which opened last week to rave reviews and SRO screenings.

    “I was told that we had 120 theaters at the start,” Sigrid recalled. “Then, on the second day, we got 150. We just kept adding cinemas, as the days went by.”
    It was a “surprise,” not only for the filmmaker, but for the entire industry, as well.
    The odds were clearly stacked against the movie—primarily because it didn’t employ the usual rom-com stars in the lead.
    Comedian Empoy Marquez and dramatic actress Alessandra de Rossi aren’t exactly renowned as box-office sensations in the conventional sense. He was always the “funny man,” and she was hardly the “leading lady” in their projects on the big and small screens.
    “I realized that these actors were boxed in by how the audience perceived them,” Sigrid pointed out. “Everyone had the same perception of the actors. That is how I got the idea of making one of the characters blind, because we usually judge people by what we see. So what if the girl cannot see the other person. Will she still fall in love?”
    The “impairment” concept, however, proved to be a blessing for a movie that had been “handicapped” by so many factors beyond the filmmaker’s control.
    Coincidentally, Sigrid was in a similar bind as her movie’s heroine during filming. “At the time, I had a broken ankle and, in a way, experienced how it felt to be a PWD (person with disability).”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    She felt “hopeless.” “It was as if I could not do anything on my own,” she recounted. “But I want to show everyone that having a disability is not an excuse. I shot and finished this movie with crutches and then eventually, a cane.”
    It was all worth it, a personal victory made sweeter every time she hears or reads glowing feedback from friends and strangers, in the real and cyberworlds.
    “I am really happy with the overwhelming response from our kababayan,” she quipped.

    Finally, indie filmmakers from the Philippines are represented in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the same organization behind the Oscars.
    The Academy has invited Filipino filmmakers Lav Diaz and Brillante Ma Mendoza to join the same elite club that was once dubbed by critic Sam Barsanti as “a not-so-shadowy cabal that runs Hollywood, breaking hearts and making dreams come true with a little bit of Oscar glory.”
    Diaz and Mendoza were among the 774 new members—recently inducted to increase the number of “women and people of color” in the Academy’s 8,000-strong membership.

    This move is seen as part of the Academy’s attempt to “reflect the growing diversity  of the filmmaking community,” while addressing the #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

    Apart from Diaz and Mendoza, other Asian filmmakers who made it to the roster were Kim Ki-duk, Ann Hui, Takashi Miike, Johnnie To and Tran Anh Hung.
    Mendoza, Cannes best director winner for “Kinatay” in 2009, welcomed the Academy’s invitation.
    “I am glad that we now have representation in the Academy,” Mendoza told the Inquirer. “In spite of our contrasting aesthetics, Lav and I were invited to join the same group.
    This can only mean that Hollywood now recognizes Philippine cinema.”
    It’s a historic first for the country, Mendoza quipped. “It’s a good development, and I hope other Filipino filmmakers will continue our work of making positive contributions to the world of cinema.”
    Diaz, whose “Ang Babaeng Humayo” won the Golden Lion in Venice last year, was just as upbeat about the news.
    “It sounds cool,” Diaz told the Inquirer. “It is an acknowledgment that Philippine cinema and Southeast Asian filmmaking are finally a part of the Academy’s once-exclusive forum.”
    He took note of a historical fact. “Our region has long been just an agora for Hollywood, its biggest testing market, in fact, when it comes to assessing trends in the audience’s response to its products.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Diaz pointed out: “Now, they are opening up—albeit only in terms of the Oscars’ voting process. Uy, sama na rin kayo … may konting boses na rin kayo. (You can now join us … you now have a little say.)”
    He, however, reiterated the importance of “looking into the selection process in the Foreign Language section, where the decisions are made by each country’s so-called film academies.”
    “Every year, we have really strong films that can compete, if we are only talking about competition,” he asserted. “Sadly, in our case, we have an archaic and unprogressive selection process. So shameful, naïve and utterly feudal. We have wasted so many opportunities in the past.”
    He was quick to point out, though: “I am not undermining the role of the Film Academy of the Philippines [which selects the country’s entry].”
    Diaz, however, cannot overemphasize the urgent need “to look … beyond politics and clique mentality.”
    “This is a cultural issue. This is a big responsibility,” he declared. “We should create a formidable selection committee every year. Maybe we can send two or three films, not just one. And involve members of the academe, critics, film scholars and filmmakers.”
    Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” was the Philippine entry in the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Academy Awards in 2015, while Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa” was the country’s bet last year. The country has yet to land a nomination in the Oscars’ Best Foreign Language Film category.

    Actress-turned-director Gina Alajar has witnessed the growth of the indie filmmaking scene through the years.
    She returns to Cinemalaya this year, with Sonny Calvento’s “Nabubulok.” (She first joined the annual festival on its second year in 2006, for Benji Garcia’s “Batad sa Paang Palay.” Her last Cinemalaya film was Joel Lamangan’s “Sigwa” in 2010.)
    “The level of comfort on the set has improved a lot,” she said of the changes in local indies. “Now, we have air-conditioned tents. There are Portalets—separate toilets for men and women.”

    During the bad old days, she volunteered, actors almost had to do indie films gratis et amore, “for the sake of art!”

    “Now, things are more professional,” she remarked. “The talent fee is two notches higher compared to old rates.”
    For her Cinemalaya comeback, she accepted the offer from debuting director Calvento out of sheer curiosity. “I was intrigued when I found out that he’s the son of Tony Calvento.”
    The young filmmaker’s father, a crime reporter, was behind the old TV show, “Calvento Files.” She related that she had done a few episodes of the series.
    “My ex-husband Michael [de Mesa] codirected the movie version of ‘Calvento Files’ in 1997,” she recounted. “Sonny’s dad helped us get an NBI clearance. Wala lang. History lang.”
    Now, it’s time for the actress to return the favor, and she was not disappointed.
    “Sonny has a competent team behind him—mostly his coworkers in ABS-CBN, where he writes for TV shows,” she pointed out. “It was a good experience. The whole team was caring and respectful. These kids knew how to deal with actors.”
    She made sure not to make the newbie filmmaker feel intimidated—even though she is a director herself. “I didn’t meddle on the set. I was quiet all the time. Good girl ako!”

    Although she is now more known as the director of such GMA 7 series as “Pinulot Ka Lang sa Lupa,” she is more partial to acting in front of the camera these days.
    Before returning to acting on the small screen, she finished two indie movies with Adolfo Alix Jr., who helped her win a Golden Screen best actress award for “Mater Dolorosa” in 2012.
    In Alix’s “Madilim ang Gabi,” Alajar is reunited with Bembol Roco and Phillip Salvador, her costars in Lino Brocka’s “Orapronobis.”
    “The last time we acted together was in 1989, in ‘Orapronobis,’” she looked back. The three are known as the original Brocka babies.
    It was a heartwarming reunion, she owned up. “The emotions are very personal for me. We’ve known each other for a long time. When we see each other, we don’t talk about work.”
    Instead, she makes it a point to catch up on the latest goings-on in their lives. “We’ve been through so much. When I see them, I ask them: How are you? Are you happy?”
    For her, personal connections are more valuable. “This is just work. We’re all getting older. I’m really interested to know what we’ve learned after all these years.”
    She recalled that when she and Salvador worked on Brocka’s “Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim” in 1984, her son Geoff Eigenmann (who’s now an actor, too) was still in her tummy. “Later, I brought Geoff to the set, and Lino would call him Santo Niño because he was so cute and had curly hair,” she reminisced.
    She has another movie with Salvador, Alix’s “Pastor.”
    Speaking of unexpected reunions, she bumped into another Brocka baby, Sharon Cuneta, at the Cinemalaya launch held at the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) on Thursday.
    Alajar costarred with the Megastar in Brocka’s “Biktima” in 1990.
    Alajar felt a tad embarrassed when Cuneta praised her as a shoo-in in the best actress race.
    “Ano ba naman s’ya,” she said. “I really don’t think of awards. It seems all the entries are good this year… Imagine, the Megastar has a Cinemalaya entry. It just goes to show that Cinemalaya is becoming bigger and broadening its horizons!”
    Cinemalaya runs at the CCP and Ayala Cinemas from Aug. 4 to 13.

    Scene from Mario Cornejo’s award-winning indie
    A Filipino film will be shown in theaters in Poland soon. Mario Cornejo’s “Apocalypse Child” will be released in the country beginning Oct. 6. Special screenings will also be set in “selected summer festivals” before its regular run in that country.
    “Apocalypse Child” won best picture at the 10th Five Flavours Film Festival in Warsaw last year.
    According to producer Monster Jimenez, the Five Flavours festival has now gone into theatrical distribution, with the Filipino film as its maiden offering.

    “We were thrilled that Five Flavours wanted to distribute our film,” Cornejo told the Inquirer. “We related a very personal story that could only be told in a specific part of the Philippines. To think that a Polish audience that’s almost 10,000 kilometers away will see it is mind-boggling.”

    The film tells the story of a listless surfer who grew up thinking that he is the love child of a Baler maiden with Oscar-winning filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola.
    “Apocalypse Child” features Sid Lucero in the lead role, with Annicka Dolonius, RK Bagatsing, Ana Abad Santos and Gwen Zamora in the ensemble.
    The fest’s site points out that “Asian films are a rarity in Polish cinemas, with only a few titles being released each year.” As such, the Five Flavours organizers have decided to “fill this gap in the local market and bring more attention to Asian cinema in Poland throughout the year.”
    The festival-turned-distribution company is fully “committed to present the diversity of contemporary Asian movies: from small, independent productions to mainstream hits.”

    Carlo Francisco Manatad’s short film “Jodilerks dela Cruz, Employee of the Month,” will be screened at the 11th NexT International Film Festival in Romania, from June 22 to 26.
    Topbilled by Angeli Bayani in the title role, Manatad’s movie premiered in the International Critics’ Week section of the Cannes Film Festival last month.
    In Romania, “Jodilerks” will vie for the top prize in the festival’s international competition category.

    A unique characteristic of the festival is that it highlights not just the director, but the sound designer, as well. The NexT fest likewise featured Mikael Andrew Quizon, “Jodilerks” sound designer, on its website.
    The event is spearheaded by the NexT Cultural Society, which aims to “discover and support talented filmmakers at the beginning of their careers, and to promote auteur films and cinema as art.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Liz Alindogan in “People Power Bombshell: The Diary of Vietnam Rose”
    John Torres’ film, “People Power Bombshell: The Diary of Vietnam Rose,” won Special Mention in the New Views section of the sixth Olhar de Cinema: Curitiba International Film Festival held recently in Brazil.
    Torres’ film mixes footage from Celso Ad Castillo’s unfinished 1980s movie, “The Diary of Vietnam Rose,” with recent interviews with its cast and crew, led by actress-producer Liz Alindogan.
    “I had always wondered how this would translate to young foreign audiences abroad,” Torres told the Inquirer.
    “To get this award gives me enough courage to explore more ways of making films and documentaries—
    knowing that there is a segment of the population that has this openness to new cinematic languages and ways of looking at the world.”

    The site says Torres is “among the recent strong voices arising in Philippine cinema…continuing to tread one of the most singular trajectories with a filmmaking [style that’s] both deeply personal and capable of confronting the dilemmas of his country.
    “People Power Bombshell” is summed up as “a reflection that gains increasingly complex human and social contours throughout its duration.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    A Filipino movie will be competing in the main section of the 20th Shanghai International Film Festival in China, from June 17 to 26. Paolo Villaluna’s “Pauwi Na (Pedicab)” is vying for Shanghai’s Golden Goblet Award, along with films from Romania, Poland, Italy, the United States, Bangladesh/India, China, Japan, United Kingdom, Iran, Germany and Macedonia/Russia/Lithuania.
    Villaluna told the Inquirer that “Pauwi Na” is the only Southeast Asian movie in the lineup. According to the director, lead actors Bembol Roco and Cherry Pie Picache will be attending the fest with him.
    “Pauwi Na” won best actor (for Roco), best actress (for Picache), Jury Special Award for Outstanding Film, best editing, production design and story at the first ToFarm Film Festival last year. The film was inspired by an Inquirer story on a family that goes back to the province, traveling from Manila to Bicol (433.4 kilometers) in a pedicab.

    Walking on the red carpet during the awards ceremony felt like “a dream,” Hemedez quips. “Some of the kids gave us a high-five. It was the most enjoyable part of the evening.”
    Jurors came from South Korea, Australia, United Arab Emirates, India, Japan, Hong Kong, Ukraine and the United States.
    Ibañez recalls that “1st Sem” had two screenings at the CGV Cinemas in Seoul.
    Hemedez admits that he felt proud “seeing the ‘1st Sem’ poster displayed alongside those of Korean movies in the theaters.”
    Ibañez relates: “Lots of teenagers, parents and kids joined us. South Korean parents approached us to tell us how much they loved the film. A high school student, who dreams of becoming a filmmaker, said he liked our film, which was the first Filipino movie he has ever seen.”
    “The teener interviewed Allan for almost an hour,” Hemedez looks back. “Juno Park, a young Korean short filmmaker, described our movie as humorous, heartwarming and inspiring.”
    Some Korea-based Filipinos caught the movie, as well. “We were comforted by their comment that our film had brought them back home,” Ibañez recounts.

    According to the fest’s website, entries were chosen “on the basis of quality and originality” [telling stories that] assist in developing the role cinema plays in the education and enrichment of young people.”
    “1st Sem” previously won in India, Canada and the United States and was graded A by the Cinema Evaluation Board. It will have its Los Angeles premiere on Sept. 14 at The Art Theater in Long Beach, California.

    Two Filipino movies will be shown at the 20th Shanghai International Film Festival in China, from June 17 to 26. Avid Liongoren’s “Saving Sally” and Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards” are included in Shanghai’s “The Belt and Road” program, which is envisioned to “enhance international communication.”
    “The Belt and Road” section features films from Bhutan, Afghanistan, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Macedonia and Iran.
    The Shanghai fest is one of the Top 15 A-list festivals accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers’ Associations. It seeks to “create opportunities for promising newcomers and present foreign and domestic movie cultures to audiences.”

    <content>US critics praise Lav Diaz’s ‘epic, richly rewarding’ ‘Humayo’

    The reviews are in, and they are nothing short of “epic,” as the New York Times and the Village Voice put it.
    In time for its limited theatrical run in the United States this month, Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” is greeted with lavish praise from various mainstream critics.
    Diaz often makes lengthy films that are deemed, with more than a tinge of trepidation, by most US reviewers as “marathon” sessions.

    In a May 18 article, however, the New York Times’ A.O. Scott points out that the Filipino film, which won the Golden Lion in Venice last year, “is carefully composed and hauntingly beautiful to behold.”

    And what does length have to do with it? Absolutely nothing, as far as Scott is concerned: “It is long and slow-moving, but at nearly four hours, it feels less like a test of your endurance than an appeal to your appetite for character, incident and emotion.”
    Scott notes that it is “more portrait than tableau… [bringing] to the screen a character who is at once elusive and unforgettable.” That character is named Horacia and is “played with exquisite understatement” by actress-turned-media executive Charo Santos-Concio.
    In sum, Scott remarks that Diaz’s latest film is “devastating… [it] makes uncompromising demands on your attention and empathy. But it is also illuminating and, in its downbeat, deliberate way, exhilarating.”
    Village Voice’s Ela Bittencourt is just as effusive. In a May 16 review, Bittencourt calls “Humayo” “a brooding, existentialist noir… a story of solidarity and redemption.”
    Bittencourt notes that “Diaz marries his sweeping narrative arc with supreme visual restraint.”
    The critic asserts that while Diaz’s “long takes can slip into pedestrian mode,” there is “suppleness to his night photography”—singling out the “rich chiaroscuros [that] evoke noirish dread.”
    In a May 17 essay, Entertainment Weekly’s Chris Nashawaty likens Diaz’s body of work to “marathon tone poems.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Diaz’s brand of “pure cinema,” however, is “set in dirty streets and back alleys where his country’s poor, forgotten people struggle to scrape their way to the next day.” It presents a rather unvarnished portrait of the Philippines “as a place without either a safety net or compassion for its lost souls… The only succor comes from small acts of empathy.”
    Nashawaty concedes that “Humayo” “may not be a movie for everyone, but if you allow yourself to settle into its leisurely tempo… it can be a richly rewarding experience.”
    In spite of all these glowing reviews, Diaz remains pragmatic and introspective. “It’s humbling,” he tells the Inquirer. “Art has answers… to all the hard work, to the long struggle for greater aesthetics and for greater cinema, to the issue of noncompromise.”
    He sees a glimmer of hope in the deluge of accolades. “The world is open to different cinemas now, to divergent perspectives and forms in this medium. The film is four hours long and [yet] it opened in selected cinemas all over the US. It is still running in Europe.”
    It is a significant development, indeed. “Kahit papaano, nakakatulong sa pagbubukas ng mga pinto para sa atin. Para sa mas malawak na pang-unawa sa kultura natin. (It somehow helps in opening doors for us. For a wider understanding of our culture.)”

    Two Filipino films will be shown at the 41st San Francisco International LGBTQ Film Festival, to be held in the United States from June 15 to 25.
    Victor Kaiba Villanueva’s “Patay Na Si Hesus” and Samantha Lee’s “Baka Bukas” are among the “groundbreaking” films chosen by organizers for reflecting “the diversity of queer stories from across the globe.”
    Also known as Frameline, the San Francisco fest, which seeks “to honor legendary filmmakers and discover emerging talents,” is touted as the “world’s premier LGBTQ event and the largest celebration of queer cinema.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    On its website, Villanueva’s movie is described as “a touching and utterly unique serio-comic take on the family road trip… [with] mischievous, queer stylings.” The site remarks that the Cebuano film “works lovingly as a microcosm for familial discord, loyalty and affection.” “Patay Na Si Hesus” topbills Cannes best actress Jaclyn Jose.

    On the other hand, Lee’s movie is summed up as a “sassy romantic dramedy in warm pastels… a refreshing look at lesbian life from a Filipino perspective.” The site points out that Lee “mixes comedy and commentary … with an easy-on-the-eye cast of up-and-comers.” “Baka Bukas” features Jasmine Curtis-Smith and Louise delos Reyes as young gay lovers.
    The two movies are products of local film festivals: the Cinema One digital fest (“Baka Bukas”) and the QCinema fest (“Patay Na Si Hesus”). Organizers note that Frameline “has a long history of supporting outstanding films and filmmakers.”

    Mikhail Red’s “Birdshot” is headed to another international event—the 3rd Valletta Film Festival in Malta from June 16 to 25.
    “Birdshot” is included in the fest’s Islanders section, which focuses on movies set on islands or produced by filmmakers who are residents of islands. The fest’s website describes the section as a “cinematic archipelago of our planet, set in one of the smallest capitals in Europe, [which is considered] a Unesco World Heritage city.”
    Meanwhile, Red’s coming project, “Eerie,” has been selected as part of the 10th Network of Asian Fantastic Films’ “It Projects.” This year, 233 entries from 39 countries submitted entries to the pitching program which will be held during the 21st Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival in South Korea, from July 13 to 23.

    Gil Portes
    Gil Portes was the epitome of an independent filmmaker. He always spoke his mind and wasn’t afraid to give his opinion on anything.”
    Thus said director Adolfo Alix Jr., whom Portes gave a break by hiring him as one of the writers for “Mga Munting Tinig.”
    Portes, the acclaimed director regarded by his peers as one of the pioneers of indie filmmaking, was found dead in his apartment in Quezon City last Wednesday. He was 71.

    “Gil was the original indie filmmaker who could crack film financing from a rock. He was tireless and resourceful,” Portes’ close friend and fellow filmmaker Mel Chionglo told the Inquirer.
    Another close friend and regular collaborator, screenwriter Eric Ramos, echoed Chionglo’s sentiments.
    “He created most of his films outside the studio system, and was able to sustain his career through independent financing,” said Ramos, who penned the script for Portes’ last movie, the historical romance, “Moonlight Over Baler.”
    As such, Portes had been credited by not a few colleagues, including close friend Joel Lamangan, for crafting movies that helped spark the spirit of what is now known as the independent filmmaking movement.
    One such film was the 2002 drama, “Mga Munting Tinig” (2002), which bagged—among a slew of trophies—the best picture award at the 2003 Famas and Urian Awards.
    The movie was likewise hailed best feature at the 2003 Palm Beach International Awards in the United States.
    Alessandra de Rossi, whose performance in “Mga Munting Tinig” as a substitute teacher in a remote school brought out her mettle as an actress, said she would remember Portes as one of the “most passionate filmmakers” she had ever worked with. For a time, Portes considered Alex as his muse.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “He’s my signature director. And he used to call me his signature actress, too, because we did a lot of projects together: ‘Munting Tinig,’ ‘Homecoming’ (2003), ‘Barcelona’ (2006) and ‘Liars’ (2012),” she said.
    De Rossi also described Portes as “an artist and a mentor in every sense of the word. He used to tell me, ‘O, Alex, ’naku, pang-best actress ito ha! Galingan mo, kalaban mo na naman si Ate Vi!” she recalled.
    “Mindanao,” which Portes intended to submit to this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival, could have been his fifth film with De Rossi.
    Throughout his career, Portes was able to work with some of the biggest local movie outfits, like Viva and Regal, although he didn’t have to rely on them.
    Portes holds the distinction of having directed the most number of films that went on to become the Philippine’s official entries to the Academy Awards’ best foreign language film category. He had three: “Saranggola” (1999), “Gatas… Sa Dibdib ng Kaaway” (2001) and “Mga Munting Tinig,” which made it to the Top 8—the closest any local film had gotten to an Oscar nomination.
    While Portes had been in the scene for the past 40 years, his love for cinema didn’t seem to have waned one bit. Last week, he set meetings with potential actors for “Mindanao.”
    “It has a great story—sayang ‘di na matutuloy,” actor Rocco Nacino said. “We had a productive meeting, and we were both very excited about the movie. We talked about our families and careers.”

    Khavn dela Cruz in “Alipato”
    Filipino filmmaker Khavn dela Cruz recently served up a double whammy in Oberhausen, Germany: a retrospective of his films and a thoroughly indie installation work, dubbed “Happyland.”
    Organizers lined up 15 films in the program, but the pièce de résistance was the installation work that stood on a 1,000-square meter space, Dela Cruz told the Inquirer.
    Part of the 63rd International Short Film Festival, the exhibit “Happyland” was held recently at the Hall of the Association for Contemporary Art Ruhrgebiet in Altenberg.

    Touted by organizers as Dela Cruz’s “largest show outside the Philippines,”“Happyland” recreated scenes from Dela Cruz’s 2012 film, “Mondomanila”: “The slums, paintings, photos, drawings, jeepney stencils, stamps, tarpaulin art.”

    The fest’s website summed up the installation as a “dump, a heavenly body, an orgy session, a punk explosion.”
    In a way, the site pointed out, “Happyland” also “questioned a festival’s conventions.” “It was a collective-anarchic art event, more laboratory than finished piece, a work that didn’t aim to be permanent and came alive through participation.”
    Audience involvement was greatly encouraged.
    The site asserted that the “immersive” retro/exhibit allowed visitors not only to watch Dela Cruz’s films (made from 1994 to 2017), “they could also dance, listen to music or poems or lectures and eat.”
    Yup, eat!
    Dela Cruz brought in his catering company’s cook, Carina Ulan, who whipped up good old-fashioned carinderia chow—laing, adidas (chicken feet), sisig, Bicol express, lugaw—for the German crowd. “They loved the Filipino dishes,” Dela Cruz recalled.
    Quite aptly, the video shown in the installation space was titled “Mashed Kamote.”

    There was also a fashion show (held from the train station to the exhibition hall) and concerts headlined by Dela Cruz’s Kontra Kino Orchestra. “It was composed of several musicians from Germany, the United Kingdom and the Philippines—including Brezel Göring, Bing Austria and Mlou Matute.”
    In true Pinoy fashion, guests were enticed to belt out songs in Sexmoan KTV, a videoke bar set within the installation space.
    Dela Cruz likewise dared intrepid guests (who were blindfolded) to get a haircut from him. “I did a few haircuts at my own place that we called F for Fake News Barbershop,” he related.“Panalo! (Winner!) Everyone was raving about the event.”
    The shindig, which opened with his 2006 film “Rugby Boyz,” featured a dozen of his works in the retro, including “Aswang” (2017), “Aklat ng Bagyo at Dilim” (2012), “Lata at Tsinelas” (2004) and “Alaala ng Madaling Araw” (1996).
    Also in the Oberhausen fest, Dela Cruz curated a collection of 60-second short films called “Nightmares of the Sun,” under the aegis of “The One Minutes.”
    Dela Cruz asked filmmakers from the Philippines, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Thailand to “visualize their daily nightmares.”
    From the International Short Film Festival in Oberhausen, “Nightmares of the Sun” will proceed to different cities in Europe (Amsterdam) and Asia (Shanghai).

    The much-heralded and debated “Third Golden Age” of Philippine cinema will be showcased at Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, with a series of film screenings from June 1 to 25.
    It’s certainly not the first time for Filipino films to be shown at MoMA since different local movies have had intermittent screenings through the years. Next month, however, the venerable American cultural institution will “present a survey of Philippine movies from 2000 to the present”—acknowledging and celebrating a period dubbed as the Third Golden Age.
    (The First Golden Age supposedly unfolded in the 1950s, while the Second Golden Age spanned the 1970s and early ’80s, according to the MoMA website.)

    The MoMA describes the ongoing “wave of sustained creativity” as “unusual in its diversity of genre and style, audacious formal experimentation, and multiplicity of personal, social and political perspectives.”

    Powered by digital technology, this gilded era “defies simple description,” because of its “dizzying array of distinct cinematic statements [that make it] an exceptionally unique, vibrant movement.”
    Included in the retrospective are 18 films made by 13 directors—including two documentaries, Ditsi Carolino’s “Bunso” (2004) and Ramona Diaz’s “Motherland” (2017).
    Angeli Bayani in “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan”
    Among the 16 feature films in the lineup are works by two of the most awarded and admired leaders of the current filmmaking scene, Lav Diaz and Brillante Ma Mendoza.
    Diaz, who won the Golden Lion in Venice for “Ang Babaeng Humayo” last year, is commended by the MoMA site for his “minimalist tales rendered at epic lengths.”
    Meanwhile, Mendoza, who won best director in Cannes for “Kinatay” in 2009 and whose “Ma’ Rosa” won best actress for Jaclyn Jose in Cannes last year, is lauded by the site for his “gritty realist portrayals of the margins of society.”
    Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan,” which premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section in 2013, and “Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon,” which won the Golden Leopard in Locarno in 2014, will be shown at MoMA.
    Mendoza, for his part, will present three films which likewise made waves in festivals abroad: “Serbis” (2008), “Thy Womb” (2012) and “Ma’ Rosa” (2016).

    Jodi Sta. Maria in “Aparisyon”
    Also, singled out by the site were Raya Martin (for his “experimentation with storytelling”) and Erik Matti (for his “riveting thrillers”).
    Two of Martin’s solo films—“Independencia” (2009) and “How to Disappear Completely” (2013)—will be shown at the MoMA. On the other hand, Matti will screen “On the Job” (2013).
    Completing the list are Kidlat Tahimik’s “BalikBayan Box #1: Memories of Overdevelopment Redux VI” (1979-2017), Adolfo Alix Jr. and Martin’s “Manila” (2009), Isabel Sandoval’s “Aparisyon” (2012), Ato Bautista’s “Gemini” (2014) and “Expressway” (2016), Marlon Rivera’s “Babae sa Septic Tank” (2011), Pepe Diokno’s “Engkwentro” (2009) and Hannah Espia’s “Transit” (2013).
    Marc Justine Alvarez and Jasmine Curtis-Smith in “Transit”
    MoMA’s website hails the chosen filmmakers as artists who “push cinematic boundaries and [tackle] subjects as varied as colonial legacy, martial law, drugs, crime, corruption, fertility and migration.”
    Founded in 1929 and located in Midtown Manhattan, MoMA is “a place that fuels creativity, ignites minds and provides inspiration.”

    The Filipino docu, which won best picture at last year’s Metro Manila Film Festival, will be shown with movies from United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Syria/Lebanon and Australia.
    According to its website, the Taoyuan fest aims to “cultivate an interest in cinema, [by] building an audience that will be given access to films not usually screened in local theaters.” The fest is also “dedicated to Asian docus … providing a platform to the region’s filmmakers to exchange ideas and experiences with local audiences.”

    MANILA, Philippines — The estranged husband of comedienne Ai-Ai Delas Alas wants the actress cited in contempt of court for granting media interviews and allegedly violating a gag order issued by a Quezon City judge.
    Businessman Jed Salang, who was sued by Delas Alas for violation of the Anti-Violence against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 and against whom the comedienne sought a permanent protection order (PPO) from the Quezon City Regional Trial Court’s Branch 94, filed his contempt petition on Thursday and it was raffled off to Branch 216.
    Salang said that during the June 19 pre-trial conference regarding the case against him, Judge Roslyn Rabara-Tria issued a gag order urging the parties to refrain from making disclosures on the merits of the case to the media and social networking sites.

    Tria said in her pre-trial order, “The parties, counsels and their privies are hereby directed to refrain from giving any interviews or comments about this case to the media, or social media networking under pain of contempt.”

    “Yet, even after issuance of said gag order, Respondent (Delas Alas) appeared in different forms of media while peddling the merits of her case. This is in direct violation not only of the gag order but the sub judice rule as well, to the extreme prejudice of Petitioner (Salang),” he alleged.
    He claimed that in the July issues of “The Buzz” and “Yes! Magazine”, information pertaining to the merits of the case against him were revealed.
    In the Yes! Magazine article, he said, “The article features an interview of respondent… and discusses with appalling clarity and depth, issues pertaining to the merits of Respondent’s (Delas Alas’) case.”
    Likewise he said that Delas Alas “appeared on television on June 23, 2013 in a segment in the program The Buzz aired by ABS-CBN Network and interviewed thereat. This is a blatant violation of the sub judice rule and the gag order.”
    Salang alleged, “Her extrajudicial representations effectively engendered a negative perception against Petitioner (Salang) in the minds of the public, especially that she is a well-known celebrity. These representations tend, directly or indirectly, to influence the decision of the controversy and consist in unlawful interference with the proceedings in said civil case.”
    He concluded his petition by asking that Delas Alas, after notice and hearing, “be punished for indirect contempt of court,” with a penalty deemed just and proper by the court.
    The actress filed the complaint against Salang last May 24 and sought a temporary protection order to prevent Salang from coming within 100 meters of her, members of her family as well as staff and household members by at least 100 meters.

    Judge Tria issued a temporary protection order for the duration of the hearings which includes a prohibition of any form of communication by Salang through text messages, phone calls or emails with Delas Alas.
    The comedienne had claimed in her complaint that she was subjected to physical abuse by her husband on several instances before and after they were married. The couple got married on April 3 at a civil wedding in Las Vegas, Nevada and separated on May 2.

    A film on the aftermath of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” has been chosen to be part of the Torino FilmLab’s FeatureLab 360. Carlo Francisco Manatad’s debut feature film, “Whether the Weather is Fine,” will join other planned projects (from Algeria, Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Vietnam and Denmark, among others) in FeatureLab.
    Manatad cowrote the film, formerly titled “A Wrong Season,” with fellow filmmaker Giancarlo Abrahan. The coming film will show the aftereffects of “the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines” and is set in Tacloban City, the director’s hometown.
    Joining Manatad in Torino, Italy, is the film’s producer Armi Rae Cacanindin (of Quantum Films).

    A year-round laboratory, the Torino FilmLab “supports emerging talents from all over the world (with a special focus on those working on their first and second films), through training, development, funding and distribution activities.”
    Its site relates that FilmLab participants can join two project development workshops and the TFL Meeting Event.
    The Tacloban film is also supported by Talents Tokyo of FILMeX. It’s also part of Italy’s Ties That Bind and Cannes’ La Fabrique des Cinemas du Monde programs, the Hanoi Project Market and Busan’s Asian Cinema Fund.
    Meanwhile, Manatad’s latest short film, “Jodilerks dela Cruz, Employee of the Month,” has been picked up for sales and distribution by Stray Dogs International, which is based in Paris, France. “Jodilerks” is set to premiere as the country’s entry in the La Semaine de la Critique (International Critics’ Week section) of the ongoing Cannes Film Festival in France.
    Manatad is one of the honorees in last December’s Indie Bravo! Awards for the short film, “Sandra.”
    Today and tomorrow, the UPFI Film Center will present three short films by alumnus Manatad (“Sandra,” “Junilyn Has” and “Fatima Marie Torres and the Invasion of Space Shuttle Pinas 25”) at the Cine Adarna in UP Diliman.

    Lav Diaz’s “Siglo ng Pagluluwal (Century of Birthing)” can be viewed on the website Mubi for a whole month. The 360-minute film premiered in the Orizzonti section of the Venice Film Festival in 2011 and was later screened at the Toronto International Film Festival that same year.
    The Mubi site describes the drama film as “an epic meditation on the role of the artist and the rise of fundamentalism … which will destroy the world.”
    Variety’s Robert Koehler remarks that, with this film, “Diaz continues to push, prod and reinvent his personal yet universal cinema … serving up ideas on matters of belief, creation and freedom that ultimately skew in a more hopeful direction than some of [his] recent epics.”

    Dubbed “It’s About Time: The Cinema of Lav Diaz,” the “monumental” retro showcases such award-winning films as “Melancholia,” “Death in the Land of Encantos,” “Florentina Hubaldo, CTE,” “Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon” and “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan.”
    An “online cinematheque,” Mubi is available in 200 territories all over the world. —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    <content>Angeli returns to Cannes
    
    
    Angeli Bayani and Archie Alemania in Cannes after the “Norte” premiere in 2013
    A film starring actress Angeli Bayani returns to Cannes four years after she had two entries in the world’s most prestigious festival— Lav Diaz’s “Norte: Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” in Un Certain Regard and Anthony Chen’s “Iloilo” in the Directors’ Fortnight.
    This year, Angeli topbills Carlo Francisco Manatad’s short film, “Jodilerks dela Cruz, Employee of the Month,” which is competing in the 56th Critics’ Week (Semaine de la Critique) of the 70th Cannes Film Festival in France, from May 18 to 26.
    At press time, Angeli just got word that she would be joining the Philippine contingent, led by director Carlo and producer Joji Alonso, on the Croisette.

    More than for herself, she’s thrilled for her director. “Personally, I am much more excited for him. I’m very happy that his unique brand of comedy has been getting a lot of international attention lately. I hope that Cannes will give him the mileage that young filmmakers need.”
    True enough, she proudly reported that her director had been asked “to participate in Next Step, a program that aims to support the 10 short filmmakers in Critics’ Week.”
    “It seems that Carlo is well on his way,” she quipped.
    In the short film, which the director hopes to develop into a full-length feature, Angeli portrays a gas station attendant.
    “Jodilerks strikes me as someone who would rather be anywhere… than where she is,” pointed out Angeli, who is adept at playing pugnacious, proletarian women. “Circumstances may have prevented her from finding greener pastures, but she makes the most of her condition. As the title says, she is dedicated enough to consistently be ‘employee of the month.’”

    She noted, however, that like most “unhappy people, Jodilerks is a ticking time bomb, and she knows that time is almost up.”
    To prepare for the role, she took lessons on “how to operate a gas pump.”

    “It’s not as easy as it looks,” she recounted.
    In “Norte” and “Iloilo,” Angeli embodied the resilience, the grit and grace of Filipino women; “Jodilerks” is a rather unconventional addition to this list of valiant heroines.
    “They are similar in the sense that they’re all women trying to get by despite dire situations,” the actress remarked. “The difference is, Jodilerks clearly has other plans. When she finally comes to terms with that, she does something decisive which, to me, almost comes out of left field, if it weren’t for the horror of her recent experience.”
    Seen in that light, Jodilerks is Everywoman. “It took a while, and it took a lot for her trigger to be pulled, but she finally does what most people merely think of doing.”
    She expressed the hope that foreign viewers and critics would appreciate “Carlo’s exceptional humor.” “While the film shows a micro situation… he proves that it’s possible to depict it in a humorous way, without losing relevance and impact.”
    Fest organizers have hailed the film as “fanciful and touchingly inventive.”
    “This film is important so that foreigners would learn that the Philippines has a young filmmaker like Carlo who can dish out social commentary and be funny about it, too,” she explained.
    What makes this Cannes trip extra special, though, is that she gets to share it with boyfriend and costar Ross Pesigan.
    “We had so much fun doing the film. I have dreamed of going back to Cannes with Ross, and I am happy that my dream is coming true,” she said.

    Rhian Ramos in “Saving Sally”
    When it rains, it pours for Sally.
    Avid Liongoren’s “Saving Sally” brought home top honors from two international film festivals, scoring a triple victory in the United States early this month.
    The live-action-animated film bagged the special jury prize (in the international narrative competition) and the audience award (in the international narrative feature section) at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival in California last May 4.

    Liongoren, who traveled to the United States for the event, had mixed emotions about the unexpected victory. “It felt great, of course. But I was also slightly disappointed because I was in a meeting on the other side of the city during the awards ceremony.”
    To make up for the letdown, he took photos with vehicles used in the series “Breaking Bad” and film “Ghostbusters” that were parked near the place where he had the meeting.
    The LA screening “went quite well,” he recounted.
    “At first, we weren’t sure if people would watch because we were scheduled on a Monday during rush hour. But viewers came and didn’t throw eggs at us and clapped, instead,” he recalled. “Many folks watched our film randomly, without knowing anything about it, so it’s nice to know how pleasantly surprised they were.”
    He was glad to garner another laurel for the film. “Pampalasa ng adobo. (To make my adobo more flavorful.)”
    “Sally” also scored the Best Family Film plum at the Bentonville Film Festival in Arkansas last May 7.
    Since the director-animator wasn’t able to fly to Arkansas, “Sally” screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra attended the Bentonville fest on his behalf.

    Liongoren is ecstatic about the triple triumph, which is a “good reason to celebrate by wolfing down a giant chili hot dog and getting drunk on rootbeer.”
    Seriously now. “We hope that these recognitions will increase our chances in bringing the film to a wider audience. Much work needs to be done, but every citation is an encouragement.”

    Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” won the audience award at the Festival de Cinema d’Autor or D’A held recently in Barcelona, Spain.
    According to its site, Diaz’s triumph signifies that the fest has a “high degree of cinephilia (love for cinema) … unrestrained and unprejudiced.”
    The fest describes Diaz’s film as “torrential.” “Humayo” confirms that “the fest’s followers have cinema in their DNA. The movie’s length (226 minutes) didn’t frighten them—instead, they felt greatly rewarded at the end.”

    “Humayo” edged out films like Mike Mills’ “20th Century Women,” Elena Martin’s “Julia Ist,” Ben Wheatley’s “Free Fire” and David Arratibel’s “Converso” in the public voting.

    “Cool,” Diaz said of his latest honor. “Nakakahabol na ang masa. (The public is now catching up.)”
    Held from April 27 to May 7, the D’A fest is hailed “as the biggest cinematic manifestation” in Barcelona.
    This year, 80 films were showcased in the event that gathered film buffs with “a hunger and thirst for good movies.”
    Last year’s Golden Lion winner at the Venice Film Festival, “Humayo” will open in US theaters on May 19. —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Ronwaldo Martin and Hasmine Killip in Venice
    The lead stars of Eduardo Roy Jr.’s “Pamilya Ordinaryo” bagged the top acting prizes in a New York festival. Hasmine Killip won best actress and Ronwaldo Martin, best actor, at the 12th Harlem International Film Festival, held on Sunday in the United States. This is Killip’s fifth international acting honor for the Cinemalaya winner, and Martin’s first award ever.
    “I’m happy because I really wanted to win,” Martin told the Inquirer. “Finally, I got to hook a trophy. I offer this award to my family: My Mama and Papa, to my siblings, especially Kuya Dheng (actor Coco Martin, or Rodel Nacianceno in real life) and my grandmother.”
    He said he was grateful to director Roy, the entire “Ordinaryo” team, and his screen partner Killip, “whose excellence pushed me to do well, too.”

    Since the fest believes that everyone has “unique experiences and perspectives to share,” it endeavors to “exhibit fresh work by the finest filmmakers from Harlem and across the globe.” Among the members of the festival’s board
    of advisors are actors Susan Sarandon and Keith David, filmmaker Mira Nair and playwright Eve Ensler. —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Garry Cabalic in “Paglipay”
    Zig Dulay’s “Paglipay” won in two festivals in Bali, Indonesia, this month. The Filipino movie bagged the Platinum World Award for International Feature Film at the World Film Awards, which was organized by the Cinema XXI, the largest theater network in Indonesia.
    “Paglipay” also brought home the International Award of Excellence at the International Film Festival for Environment, Health, Culture (IFFEHC).
    “I’m very happy for these honors,” Dulay told the Inquirer. “It feels good that our film was able to contribute to the good reputation of our country in filmmaking. Also, that we were able to give something back to the ToFarm fest, where it first won.”

    “Paglipay” tells the story of an Aeta man who falls in love with a woman from the city.
    According to its site, the World Film Awards, set from May 11 to 12, seeks to celebrate films “with excellent technique and passion, [expressing] a strong message with a unique voice.”
    On the other hand, the IFFEHC, scheduled from May 11 to 15, was established to “promote films on environment, health and culture issues… and intercultural dialogue [in pursuit of] acceptance and a deeper understanding of people and the diversity of life.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    One of the more evocative scenes in Nestor Abrogena Jr.’s “Ang Kwento Nating Dalawa” shows the indie drama’s hapless sweethearts stuck in a crowded train, in the middle of rush hour, seemingly headed nowhere.
    Newcomer Emmanuelle Vera, who plays the other half of the luckless lovers (with Nicco Manalo as her partner) in the film, recalls that shooting that particular LRT scene proved extra challenging for the cast and crew.
    “We only had permit to shoot in the station, but not on the train,” she recalls. “It was way too expensive. So we just hid the camera in a backpack. Some of the commuters kept looking at the camera, but we had no choice but to go on with the shoot.”

    Emmanuelle’s big-screen debut served as a crash course in Indie Filmmaking 101. “It was my first leading role. I had no idea how to go about it, and my job was to carry the entire film with my costar.”

    More than a screen partner, Nicco served as her on-set mentor, as well. “He was amazing. He really helped me. He shared techniques. He taught me to be natural… how to dissect the script, how to create a character and other important tools an actor needed to know.”
    She thought “Ang Kwento Nating Dalawa” was intended as a student film, to be released only at the UP Film Institute. “We had zero expectations. It was originally meant to be a thesis film.”
    But since making waves at the World Premieres fest two years ago, the movie has been building a solid following among young people. “The trailer went viral. The only reason we had a commercial screening was because there was a demand for it.”
    Now, there’s even talk of a sequel, “Tayo sa Huling Buwan ng Taon,” to be produced by TBA—the same team behind “Heneral Luna” and “I’m Drunk, I Love You.”
    “We are excited… It will be much bigger this time,” she quips.
    She concedes that, unlike most mainstream rom-coms, “Ang Kwento Nating Dalawa” is not a happy love story. “It’s kinda tragic.”
    Emmanuelle believes the audience is ready for “nonformulaic stories,” though.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Prime Cruz, the director of Emmanuelle’s latest project, the D5 Studio thriller “The Complex,” thought of casting her after watching “Ang Kwento Nating Dalawa.” “I thought she was perfect for the role of a mysterious woman,” the director says.
    Working with “The Complex” lead actor Albie Casiño was a breeze, she recounts, because they were schoolmates as kids. “We knew each other well because we were childhood friends.”
    (The 10-episode series is currently available online and can be viewed on D5 Studio’s YouTube channel.)
    Emmanuelle regards online entertainment as the future—where indie projects (and artists) can reach a wider audience.
    “The plot of ‘The Complex’ is unconventional,” she points out. “I’m hoping that online entertainment will level the playing field, so that different kinds of stories can be heard. Hopefully, the idea will catch on with the local audience soon.”
    Emmanuelle herself is an avid fan of online series, like “Riverdale” and “Stranger Things.”
    “But I also watch programs on venture capitalists like ‘Shark Tank.’ I’m interested in documentaries and cooking shows, too. Everything is online now!”

    A Filipino film made it to Cannes this year.
    Although there are no Filipino entries in the main and short film competitions, Carlo Francisco Manatad’s short film “Jodilerks dela Cruz, Employee of the Month” was chosen to be part of the competition of International Critics’ Week, known as the oldest parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival.
    The short film features actors Ross Pesigan, Ogie Tiglao and Angeli Bayani in the lead role as a gas station attendant.

    “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis”
    It was filmmaker Paul Soriano who pointed out this fact, a rare achievement for the Philippines on the global stage.
    Soriano told the Inquirer that, this year, the Philippines has won a major prize in the world’s top three A-list film festivals: Berlin, Cannes and Venice.
    Soriano is the producer of Lav Diaz’s “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis,” which bagged the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the 66th Berlinale last February.

    He noted that the country also scored big at the 69th Cannes Film Festival, with the best actress citation of Jaclyn Jose for Brillante Ma Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa” last May.

    The country’s winning streak was capped off by the Golden Lion victory of Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” at Venice, the world’s oldest film fest (which had its 73rd edition last September), he said.
    Not even heavy-hitters like the United States, France and the United Kingdom could claim this astounding triple whammy. But the Philippines did it!
    As a bonus, Filipinos also topped other A-list festivals this year.
    Ralston Jover’s “Hamog” won the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Shanghai fest in June. A few weeks later, “Hamog” star, Therese Malvar, won best actress at the Moscow fest last July.
    In another A-list Asian fest, Tokyo, the country brought home three trophies: Audience Choice for Jun Robles Lana’s “Die Beautiful” and best actor for Paolo Ballesteros for the same film, plus best film for Mikhail Red in the Asian Future section for his sophomore outing, “Birdshot.”
    Clearly, 2016 is the winningest year for Philippine cinema.
    And to celebrate this significant accomplishment, Inquirer is once again honoring these achievers at the 7th Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards, to be held tomorrow night at the paper’s Makati office.

    To mark Inquirer’s 31st anniversary, we are feting 31 international award winners.
    To further highlight the dynamism of Philippine cinema, this year’s honor roll includes veterans and newcomers, repeat winners and first-timers.
    Newbie actors Malvar, Micko Laurente (“Bambanti”), Hasmine Killip (“Pamilya Ordinaryo”) and Barbie Forteza (“Laut”) will join Indie Bravo! regulars, Allen Dizon (“Iadya Mo Kami”) and Sid Lucero (“Toto”), on the roster.
    Returning honorees are led by Mendoza (“Taklub” and “Ma’ Rosa”), Eduardo Roy Jr. (“Pamilya Ordinaryo”), Lawrence Fajardo (“Imbisibol”) and Louie Ignacio (“Area,” “Laut” and “Child Haus”).
    Seasoned directors Elwood Perez (“Esoterika: Maynila”), Joel Lamangan (“Tomodachi”) and Mel Chionglo (“Iadya Mo Kami”) will be saluted, along with young turks Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez (“1st Sem”), Charliebebs Gohetia (“I Love You. Thank You.”) and John Paul Su (“Toto”).
    Actress Lotlot de Leon (“1st Sem”) is getting her first Indie Bravo! trophy and Guyito—prizes that mom Nora Aunor has clinched twice so far.
    Awardees are not limited to feature film directors, documentarians (Sheron Dayoc for “The Crescent Rising” and Joseph Israel Laban for “Happy New Year”) and short filmmakers (Raymund Ribay Gutierrez for “Imago” and Carlo Francisco Manatad for “Sandra”) are also in Indie Bravo’s distinguished lineup.
    Apart from directors and actors, two cinematographers made it on this year’s list: Neil Daza (“1st Sem”) and Marco Felipe Villas Lopez (“The Sister”).
    For the first time, a member of the Inquirer family, Radyo Inquirer news director and filmmaker Arlyn dela Cruz (“Maratabat”), is an honoree.
    Like last year, indie artists kept winning abroad even after the cut-off—namely, directors Mario Cornejo (“Apocalypse Child”), Khavn dela Cruz (“Alipato”) and Bradley Liew (“Singing in Graveyards”) and actress Sue Prado (“The Sister”).
    That only means we need to start prepping for next year’s Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards, pronto.

    Charo Santos
    For her comeback film, Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo,” actress-network executive Charo Santos-Concio was given the Special Mention honor in acting at the 17th Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, held in the Canary Islands over the weekend. She is no stranger to international recognition, having won her first best actress trophy at the Asian Film Festival for her movie debut, Mike de Leon’s “Itim,” held in Sydney, Australia, in 1978.
    She told the Inquirer: “This piece of good news is always welcome! I am grateful to have been considered worthy of a special mention.”
    She recounted that her director Diaz had forwarded an e-mail to her. “The festival head said that the jury was torn, so they made an exception for the first time in the acting category and decided to give this special recognition.”

    Rhian Ramos in “Saving Sally”
    Avid Liongoren’s “Saving Sally” is competing at the 35th Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, which was wrapped up in Belgium recently.
    Liongoren, who traveled to Europe to attend the festival, told the Inquirer that his film’s screening last week “went well.”
    “The audience applauded thrice and was very responsive and warm,” Liongoren recalled. “They asked how I came up with the story.”

    The fest’s website lauded the movie as “an inventive rereading of the concept: ‘Will they get together or not?’”
    “Saving Sally,” which combines live action and CGI animation, is “visually … incredibly poetic,” the fest’s site commented, adding that “the modern tale owes much to the magnetic presence of [lead star] Rhian Ramos.”
    The site pointed out that Ramos might be familiar to Brussels fest regulars because she also starred in Yam Laranas’ 2009 thriller “The Road,” which was also shown in the same event.
    The site reported that the Filipino film, which premiered at last December’s Metro Manila Film Festival, took Liongoren more than a decade to complete.
    Liongoren related that audience member Philippe Hennebert had a positive feedback for the film, praising it as “an extremely pleasant surprise.”
    According to Liongoren, Hennebert remarked: It’s “visually inventive but coherent, with [its] creativity in the service of deeper subtexts and a moving storyline. [I] wish I’ll be able to watch it again [so I can pay attention to] the little graphical details, and to [confirm] that they are not gratuitous quirks, but [they] all make perfect sense.” Liongoren also participated in one of the fest’s “weird traditions.”
    “They asked all the guests to sing,” he recounted. “So I belted out the ‘Transformers’ theme song … very badly. Benta naman! (They bought it!) The point is that killjoys are not allowed in the fest!”

    Lav Diaz
    Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz won best director at the Dublin Film Critics Circle Awards, held at the Audi Dublin International Film Festival, in Ireland recently. Diaz won for his work in “Ang Babaeng Humayo,” which bagged the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival last year.
    Almost a hundred Irish and world premieres were held at the Dublin fest this year. DFCC president Tara Brady recalled that choosing the winners was a “grueling pleasure.”
    Best picture was awarded to another critically lauded film, Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “Aquarius,” starring Sonia Braga. Best actress went to Florence Pugh for ‘Lady Macbeth,’” and best actor to Sherwan Haji for “The Other Side of Hope.”

    A lot of ink was spilled on the X rating that Jerrold Tarog’s latest movie, “Bliss,” had received from the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) on its first screening.
    Although the horror film had already been reclassified as R-18 on its second review, the issue continued to spark debate among concerned industry insiders in the social and traditional media.
    MTRCB Chair Rachel Arenas welcomes the discussion engendered by the X rating and the resulting controversy.

    On its second screening at the MTRCB office in Quezon City, Tarog got to meet with the board members, Arenas recalled. “The director was able to talk to us. That’s what I want: A healthy dialogue between the board and industry representatives.”

    She pointed out that the first rating adhered to the board’s rule book, though. “According to our guidelines, it had all the elements of an X-rated film: sex, foul language, violence.”
    She, however, remarked that the film’s genre as a “psychological thriller” should also be considered.
    She related that although the chair is not tasked to review and rate films, she decided to watch the film herself to form an informed opinion on the issue.
    “But I refrained from expressing my comments, out of respect for the first committee and so as not to unduly influence the second review group,” she asserted.
    MTRCB Chair Rachel Arenas
    It was only after the result of the second screening came out that Arenas freely shared her insights with the rest of the board.
    “R-18 is fine. Adults can handle it. There’s no need to ban the film,” she told the Inquirer.
    She, however, would like to address observations that the board had become more conservative of late.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “People say there’s a trend [toward conservatism],” she acknowledged. “But I’d like to point out that the earlier case of ‘2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten’ is totally unrelated to ‘Bliss.’”
    Petersen Vargas’ “2 Cool 2 Be 4gotten” had been rated R-16, but its producer, Cinema One, asked for a second review and, as a result, got an R-18.
    “That can happen because each review group is composed of different members. The committee members you get on your second review are not the same as the first ones,” she recounted.
    She explained that she encourages divergent views in the board. “There are liberals, conservatives and moderates in the board. Listening to various opinions is always positive.”
    She, however, constantly reminds the board members to heed a simple advice whenever confronted by a dilemma.
    “When in doubt, think as a parent … [and] rely on the rule book,” she quipped.
    She had been very vocal in clarifying the board’s mandate with her colleagues even before the intrigues hit the fan.
    It’s always wise to go back to basics. “It’s in the law,” she stated. “The board is here to collaborate and cooperate with the stakeholders. It’s in our mandate. We are not here to fight with the industry. We’re working toward a common goal.”

    Paolo Ballesteros in “Die Beautiful”
    Jun Robles Lana’s “Die Beautiful,” one of the topnotchers in last December’s Metro Manila Film Festival, is headed to two international events, in Taiwan and Italy, this month.
    First stop for the “dramedy” is the 2017 Golden Horse Fantastic Film Festival, ongoing in Taipei, Taiwan, until April 16. Topbilled by MMFF and Tokyo fest best actor Paolo Ballesteros, Lana’s film will be shown at the Shin Kong Cinemas today, April 10 and 15. The fest’s website describes Lana as “one of the Philippines’ most accomplished filmmakers.”
    Now on its eighth edition, the Golden Horse event is the first fantasy film fest in Taiwan, which aims to “broaden audiences’ horizon with alternative vision.” The movie will also be screened at the 19th Far East Film Festival in Udine, Italy, from April 21 to 29.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    The “Queens” are going places.
    A week before its screening at the Hot Docs fest in Toronto, Canada, Baby Ruth Villarama’s documentary, “Sunday Beauty Queen,” will make its North American (and United States) debut at the 7th San Diego Asian Film Festival Spring Showcase in Southern California, from April 20 to 27.
    The fest’s website describes Villarama’s film as “a heartfelt documentary that captures the lives of overseas Filipino workers” who mount and compete in beauty pageants in Hong Kong. The director will attend the premiere on April 22 at UltraStar Mission Valley, which will feature an open forum,
    as well. Another screening will be held in the same venue on April 24.

    The docu shows how “the harsh, thankless realities of domestic labor are interrupted by only momentary glimpses of play and fantasy.”
    Says Hu: “Villarama captures so well the details of a life where there is little boundary between the personal and professional spheres.”
    The Queens’ struggles, Hu notes, “make the pageant that much more propulsive and emancipatory: the women dance, strut and color their lives, self-fashioning their self-worth and entertaining each other to instill pride on Sunday and beyond.”
    This year’s edition of the San Diego fest boasts its “largest” showcase yet, offering 20 “spectacular” films from 10 countries, “celebrating filmmakers, documentarians and those who explore freedom through the art of film.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Mary Joy Apostol in “Birdshot”
    After screenings in Japan, Lithuania, Laos and Sweden, Mikhail Red’s “Birdshot” will compete at the 24th Titanic International Film Festival in Budapest, Hungary, from April 6 to 13. The Filipino film is vying for the fest’s top prize with entries from Norway, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Denmark and the United States. “Birdshot” is the only Asian entry in competition.
    This year’s fest showcases films from 29 countries.
    The Titanic is considered the “biggest international film festival in Hungary.” The top prize is called the Breaking Waves Award, given by the jury to the “most outstanding, daring and innovative movie” in the lineup.

    “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    Toronto is the next stop for Baby Ruth Villarama’s “Sunday Beauty Queen.”
    The acclaimed documentary, which won best picture at the Metro Manila Film Festival last December, will be part of Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto, from April 27 to May 7.
    The docu, which celebrates the trials and triumphs of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong, is included in Hot Docs’ World Showcase program, which presents a “survey of the year’s finest nonfiction films from around the world.”

    In the fest’s website, critic Ravi Srinivasan hails the film’s titular “Queens” as “charismatic and courageous … fiery” and the docu itself as “an empowering narrative that locates new voices among the growing body of work on migrant labor.”
    Incidentally, Hot Docs is one of the “qualifying festivals for the Oscar Best Documentary category,” said Chuck Gutierrez, producer-editor of “Sunday Beauty Queen.”
    Hazel Perdido is one of the queens.
    “Our film just needs to have a one-week commercial run in New York or Los Angeles to be considered for submission to the Oscars.”
    Hot Docs is described as “North America’s largest documentary festival, offering an outstanding selection of over 200 films.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Atom on the set in Baguio
    Lights, camera, action!
    Finally, the cameras havestarted rolling for “Citizen
    Jake,” the comeback film of award-winning director Mike de Leon, which is topbilled by reporter-turned-actor Atom Araullo.

    It was a homecoming of sorts for De Leon, who set the shoot in his house in Baguio City, the same place featured as Christopher de Leon’s residence in the 1977 film “Kung Mangarap Ka’t Magising.”

    “My house … was turned into a set, sort of like ‘Kung Mangarap’ on steroids,” the filmmaker told the Inquirer. (His last film, “Bayaning 3rd World,” came out in 2000.)
    “Preproduction was crammed with work,” he recalled, so he didn’t get the chance to rest before the start of filming. Yup, he hit the ground running.
    He reported that the first day went without a hitch—generally. “It was fine at the start, but got too tiring for me toward the end.”
    Candidly, he admitted: “Except for me losing my infamous temper the following day (from sheer exhaustion), I think everybody did very well. I am very grateful that I got a good cast and crew, especially cinematographer Dix Buhay, assistant director Lorna Sanchez and production manager Martin Mayuga.”
    He also has nothing but praise for the cast: Araullo, Luis Alandy, Gabby Eigenmann, Lou Veloso, Nonie Buencamino, Victor Neri, Alan Paule, Raquel Villavicencio, Malu de Guzman, Ruby Ruiz, Nanding Josef, Anna Luna, Richard Quan, Teroy Guzman, Max Collins, Cherie Gil and Dina Bonnevie.
    Mike de Leon (right) returns to the “Kung Mangarap” house.
    “Apart from Atom, who was quite relaxed and performed well, Luis was also a revelation … I’d like to work with him again if this were not my last film,” De Leon related. “Max is a wonderful find … Not only is she incredibly stunning and luminous … she’s a terrific actress. I am lucky to have her in my film.”
    The filmmaker recently had a reunion with Bonnevie (whom he directed in “Hindi Nahahati ang Langit” in 1985) on the set.

    “It was a flashback scene. She plays the mother of the young Jake. She was very good,” he said.
    Gil, who last worked with De Leon in “Bilanggo sa Dilim” in 1986, told the Inquirer that she couldn’t wait to collaborate with the director again. “He was so humble in asking me [to be a part of the film] … He said: ‘I understand you are very busy…’ Ano ba? I will make time for you. No questions asked. I’ve been waiting for you to return for a year.”
    Atom Araullo (right) and Max Collins
    Araullo now gets to heave a sigh of relief, as the reality of his big-screen debut irrevocably sinks in. “We started off on a gentle slope, so the first day of shooting was not as traumatic as I thought [it would be]. I am slowly building up my confidence.”
    The neophyte admitted that “acting” was unfamiliar terrain for him, though. “It’s still new to me. But all these months of living and breathing Citizen Jake help a lot. I feel like I know the character inside and out.”

    Araullo owned up: “It has been a priceless learning experience so far. But to be honest, there have also been some intense challenges. Mike and I have different personalities, and we clash from time to time. But we both know that we only want the best out of this collaboration, so we are determined to see it through. In any case, the strongest steel is forged in raging infernos … so I have to get used to the heat.”
    De Leon remarked: “It’s exciting because I got to start thinking visually again, trying to tell a story using the camera and the actors. It can also be tedious and boring … you know, the drudgery of shooting. All the new technology is quite interesting, but I miss the simplicity of film.”

    <content>An MMFF wish list
    
    
    What is in store for this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), in light of the new composition of its executive committee?
    Will we see more groundbreaking films like the documentary and best picture winner “Sunday Beauty Queen,” and the animated feature “Saving Sally,” which recently brought home prizes from the Fantasporto fest in Portugal?
    Or will we see the return of formula crowd-pleasers like Enteng, Vice and their ilk?
    The future may seem uncertain, but for these filmmakers, members of Batch 2016, who slugged it out against all odds (and persevered in spite of extreme resistance from some industry insiders), hope springs eternal.
    Here’s their wish list for MMFF 2017.

    I am not super familiar with the new people in the execom (as I am a newbie in the industry), but I hope they will be as good as (2016 execom member) Moira Lang, who took the time to guide newcomers like me on the ins and outs of the business.

    BABY RUTH VILLARAMA
    Director, “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    The MMFF is about finding the best-produced stories of the year and giving the Filipino audience something memorable and worthy of their ticket purchase. I hope the submission rules will stick to picture-lock (finished) films (as a requirement) to give a fair chance to all filmmakers across the Philippines and also to give the annual festival its edge.
    CHRIS MARTINEZ
    Scriptwriter, “Ang Babae sa
    Septic Tank 2”
    I hope that having new members on board doesn’t mean going back to the old ways. We should take the learnings from last year’s successes, as well as the lessons from its failures. Whatever the perfect model is for the MMFF cannot be achieved with just one try. One thing is for sure, though: There is only one direction for real change and that is never backward; always forward.
    CHUCK GUTIERREZ
    Producer, “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    I personally welcome the new execom members. They will surely bring fresh ideas to the table. What’s troublesome is the inclusion of certain personalities involved in the 2015 MMFF scandal. We’ve already proven that Filipinos yearn for great Filipino films during the festival. We cannot afford to go back to the dark ages again.
    THEODORE BOBOROL
    Director, “Vince &amp; Kath &amp; James”
    I would like the MMFF to continue what it started last year, especially in selecting the movies. I believe, and I am hopeful, that based on last year’s results, the producers will be challenged to submit high-quality work. The priority should still be … selecting “quality” movies for the festival, regardless of whether they’re produced by independent producers or mainstream studios.
    PERCI INTALAN
    Producer, “Die Beautiful”
    Of course, with the box-office result of our entry “Die Beautiful,” we definitely view last year’s MMFF as a success and have to thank last year’s execom for making that happen.
    Bravo to them for laying the groundwork, no matter how challenging it was.
    I would like to think that the new execom also means well for the industry and the audience, and I trust that they will look into how to make things even better.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    I hope they continue to bring out the best in filmmakers and continue to rally both the audience and theater owners to celebrate how great Philippine cinema can be.
    And I hope there won’t be any “us” versus “them,” no more “indie” versus “mainstream” mentality. We are one industry, and it’s time we all work together and bring out the best in one another.
    SHANDII BACOLOD
    Producer, “Oro”
    It is comforting to think that the largest festival in our country got some balls! If MMFF 2016 was all about “change,” I think it was a success. Their so-called “reelvolution” was remarkable. With the new execom, the fitting question would be: Will they continue the [process of] “change?” Will the “reelvolution” prosper? Or will they take the same old path?
    Whatever direction the new execom will take us, I hope it will be for the industry, as we move forward toward a positive evolution.
    And when I see MMFF head Tim Orbos in person, I want to ask him: “What happened to Moira Lang and Ed Cabagnot?”
    REAL FLORIDO
    Director, “Kabisera”
    MMFF 2016 was one for the books. It was successful in introducing big game-changers to the festival. The changes in the current execom are rather interesting. Why call it a new execom when in fact only two major players were removed from the group: Moira Lang and Ed Cabagnot?
    This year’s edition should offer more improvements, based on the learnings from past editions, especially from last year’s.
    The committee must maintain the standards set by MMFF 2016. Quality should still be the top priority.
    This year’s execom must address issues on fair cinema distribution, marketing strategies and stronger alliances with theater owners and other stakeholders that will promote all entries.

    Cast and crew of “Nabubulok”
    Directing “Nabubulok” is not only the fulfillment of a childhood dream for writer Crisanto “Sonny” Calvento. It is also a project that has brought him closer to his dad, journalist Tony Calvento.
    “It’s something that we’re both excited about,” Sonny told the Inquirer of the crime and investigative film, which is one of the 10 finalists in the 2017 Cinemalaya film fest in August.
    Sonny said his dad showed support for the project by hooking him up with possible film financiers.
    “He would often reassure me about the project’s prospects,” Sonny recalled.

    The elder Calvento hosted the TV series, “Calvento Files,” which aired on ABS-CBN in the late ’90s.
    A film of the same title, directed by Laurenti Dyogi and Michael de Mesa, was released in 1997.

    Sonny said his dad also helped him secure the necessary permits for the project. He was only 8 years old when he became exposed to his father’s work on television.
    “The show is not for kids. He also had to ask permission so I could get inside the theater to watch the movie. Since then, I got interested in investigative and crime stories,” Sonny recalled.
    He added that “Nabubulok” is a story that happened to a relative of his officemate at ABS-CBN. He wrote it after attending a workshop by award-winning writer and filmmaker Armando “Bing” Lao.
    Recently, the director announced that he has finally found the American actor who will play the lead.
    Billy Ray Gallion has appeared in TV series like “Lost” (2004), “Hawaii Five-O” (2010) and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” (2013).
    “There were a lot of American actors who auditioned for the role. Out of all of them, it was only from Billy Ray that I saw sincerity. I asked all of them to act out three high points of the character that showed anger, fear and sadness. He was the only one who provided me with the most natural take, specifically on anger,” Sonny explained. “All the others resorted to shouting, but he showed me anger through his eyes. I felt he was the right actor for this.”
    “Nabubulok” is about the search for Luna. Her American husband, Jason Harper, is suspected of killing her. As Jason intends to leave the country, circumstances conspire to avert his plan.
    Sonny said he expected a lot from Billy Ray. “Jason is angry in much of the film, but he also has heart. There are many layers to him. This was what most auditionees misinterpreted. Jason isn’t a one-dimensional character.”

    The director said he was also pleased that award-winning actress-director Gina Alajar, JC Santos and Jameson Blake have agreed to get on board.
    “I guess it’s because this film is a Cinemalaya project. It’s easier to pitch it to actors and producers if they know that it’s part of the most established indie film festival in the country.”

    Lastly, Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards” is part of the Discoveries program, which “focuses on promising new directors and their well-received debut films.”
    The fest’s site describes the Discoveries lineup as “always surprising and innovative.” The films in this category are united by “an evocative search for love, lyrical loneliness and the magical connection between humans and animals.”
    These films “burst with courage and freedom… revealing the undiscovered layers… of cinema.”
    Also, these debut films “have already received glowing reviews in the biggest festivals in the world.”
    According to producer Bianca Balbuena, Liew’s film premiered in his home country, at the recent Malaysia International Film Festival, where it won best picture.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    “Sunday Beauty Queen”
    Two Philippine movies will vie for top honors in the Asean Competition of the 7th Salaya International Documentary Film Festival in Thailand, from March 18 to 26.
    Baby Ruth Villarama’s “Sunday Beauty Queen,” best picture winner at the Metro Manila Film Festival last December, will be competing with six other documentaries—including another entry from the Philippines.
    Villarama told the Inquirer that she was “grateful” that a “premier festival in Thailand” had included Filipino films in this year’s lineup.

    “It’s always amazing to share our stories with other countries, as it’s now getting more difficult to screen Filipino films in the Philippines,” she remarked. “It would be interesting to hear how the Thais would relate to the journey of our migrant workers. My hope is that, after watching the docu, they will understand us more and have a deeper connection with what we’re going through as a nation.”

    “Sunday Beauty Queen” follows Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong, as they mount and join a pageant every weekend, “gleefully reclaiming their dignity” in the process.
    The other Philippine entry at the Salaya Doc is Jeffrie Po’s “The Soil of Dreams”—which recounts “the long night of Typhoon Sendong.”
    The docu is told through the recollection of survivors—including a band of quarry workers.
    The Salaya Doc was established in 2011 by the Thai Film Foundation, in collaboration with the Film Archive.
    The two Philippine films will be competing with docus from Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    Ai-Ai delas Alas in “Area”
    Apart from the Queens World Festival (where it is competing for best director and best actress) in New York, Louie Ignacio’s “Area” will be shown,
    as part of the official selection, at the 41st Cleveland International Film Festival in Ohio, United States, from March 29 to April 9.
    Also scheduled is a screening at the 15th Boston International Film Festival, which will be held from April 13 to 17 in Massachusetts.
    According to the Cleveland fest’s website, “Area” is “a fictional tale, but its characters represent real-life archetypes. The film portrays them honestly, but never casts judgment.”

    She recalls that her director helped her every step of the way. “I heard Brad Pitt will attend the Boston fest where our film will be shown, too. I want to be there to meet him. I’m a fan!”
    Another Philippine-themed film will be shown in Cleveland, S. Leo Chiang and Johnny Symons’ documentary, “Outrun.”
    Allen Dizon in “Area”
    The docu goes on the campaign trail with Bemz Benedito, a transgender who eyes a seat in Congress. The fest’s site describes the docu as “sparkling … endearing.”
    The fest’s site hails Benedito and her colleagues in the LGBT political party Ladlad as “the bravest and most upbeat people you could have in office … With global politicians dividing us, some political fabulousness is just what the world needs.”
    According to its site, the Cleveland fest “promotes artistically and culturally significant films … to enrich the life of the community,” adding that it “presents the newest and best films from around the world.
    Apart from Cleveland, Boszton and Queens, “Area” is also part of the 50th Worldfest Houston International Film Festival in Texas, from April 21 to 30.
    One of the oldest cinema/video competitions in the world, the Worldfest Houston aims “to recognize and honor outstanding creative excellence in film … to validate brilliant abilities, promote cultural tourism, develop film production and add to the rich cultural fabric of the city.”

    After winning two awards at the All Lights India International Film Festival in Hyderabad last year, Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem” will compete at the 50th World Fest-Houston International Film and Video Festival in Texas, from April 21 to 30.
    As part of the Houston fest’s official selection, the CineFilipino 2016 film will be shown at the Flagship AMC Studio 30 Theaters.
    “It’s super exciting,” lead star Lotlot de Leon told the Inquirer. “I’m happy for my directors. It makes all the challenges they had to go through as first-time filmmakers seem worth it.”

    “In its five-decade history, the festival has discovered many filmmakers who are now big names in the industry,” Hemedez pointed out. “We consider this a huge blessing… a big opportunity.”
    Ibañez agreed, saying he was grateful that their film was included in a festival “that dedicates itself to discovering new voices. It’s more than we can ask for. It’s heartening that our film will be shown in a theater in Houston.”
    According to Ibañez, he feels honored that their film is part of a fest with a long history of promoting neophyte filmmakers.
    “It takes so much dedication and passion to sustain a 50-year tradition. So we are happy, proud and excited to be a part of it.”
    Hemedez said: “We hope this fest will open more doors for our film, which tackles two themes—family and education—that are important to a lot of people, no matter where they are from. We hope to share this film with as many students, teenagers, teachers and parents as possible.”
    Ibañez remarked: “We are eager to share our film with the Houston community, but we hope that Filipinos in Texas will take time to watch it, as well.”
    The comedy-drama film, which tells the story of a single mom coping with her eldest son’s transition to college life, will be shown in local cinemas starting April 26. Hemedez and Ibañez were among the honorees in the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards last year.

    Pepe Smith in “Singing in Graveyards”
    Two Filipino productions won big at the 2017 Malaysia International Film Festival and Malaysia Golden Global Awards, held at the Arena of Stars, ResortsWorld Genting, Malaysia, on March 5.
    Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards,” which topbills Filipino rock icon Pepe Smith, bagged the best film honor, while Brillante Ma Mendoza won best director for “Ma’ Rosa,” which stars Cannes best actress Jaclyn Jose.
    Liew, who is originally from Malaysia, told the Inquirer: “When they announced it, we couldn’t believe it, as the nominees’ list was insanely competitive. It was surreal. But [producer] Bianca [Balbuena] and I couldn’t be happier.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The win is made more poignant because it is the film’s “Malaysian homecoming,” Liew explained. “I’m so glad that both the Malaysian audience and the international jury were able to connect with the film. Hats off to my crew, the cast and, of course, to the man himself, Pepe Smith!”

    Mendoza quipped: “I am happy and surprised at the same time. I didn’t know that the film was in competition.”

    Jaclyn Jose in “Ma’ Rosa”
    The Malaysia Golden Global Awards seeks to “involve filmmakers from the Asian region  … to provide opportunities and an accessible platform … at a local and international level … to champion new creative talents [and] to reward excellent films and filmmakers.”
    The two Filipino productions competed with such Oscar-caliber films as Asghar Farhadi’s “The Salesman” (which won the Academy’s best foreign language film this year) and Maren Ade’s “Toni Erdmann.”

    The New York-based distribution company recently acquired all North American rights to another Venice winner, Stéphane Brizé’s “A Woman’s Life,” which bagged the Fipresci prize last year.

According to the firm’s site, “Ang Babaeng Humayo” and “A Woman’s Life” are set to have “theatrical runs starting in May in New York City before expanding to other cities all over the United States.”

    Scene from “Walking Street”
    Sinag Maynila goes regional. Apart from showcasing Filipino-produced films, the three-year-old festival is bookended by two Asian productions.
    The festival’s opening film is the omnibus presentation, “Asian Three-Fold Mirror 2016: Reflections,” produced by the Japan Foundation Asian Center and the Tokyo International Film Festival.
    The triptych features the works of Japan’s Isao Yukisada (“Pigeon,” set in Malaysia), Cambodia’s Sotho Kulikar (“Beyond the Bridge”) and the Philippines’ Brillante Ma Mendoza (“Shiniuma: Dead Horse”).

    In “Shiniuma,” Mendoza, who is Sinag Maynila’s festival director, tells the story of an elderly Filipino farm worker (Lou Veloso) who returns to the Philippines after being deported from Japan.
    The screening of “Reflections” will be held on March 9, at SM Aura Premier.
    Meanwhile, South Korean director Sang-woo Lee’s “Walking Street” will serve as the fest’s closing film.
    Set in Thailand, the film follows three social misfits (a mute, his criminal-brother and the prostitute they love) who find themselves stuck in paradise—the resort city of Pattaya. “Walking Street” topbills Sung-hyun Baek, Ji-soo Yoo, Si-gang Lee and Song-yi Lee. “Walking Street” will be shown on March 12, 7 p.m., at the SM Aura Premier, after the fest’s awards ceremony.
    Sang-woo’s debut film, “Tropical Manila,” was screened at the Rotterdam fest in 2008 and his sophomore outing, “My Mother is a Whore,” was shown at the Hong Kong fest in 2009. Last year, “Walking Street” debuted at the Singapore fest, where his 2015 feature “Dirty Romance” was also shown.
    Sinag Maynila—which will hold screenings at SM Megamall, SM North Edsa, Glorietta and Gateway—will wrap up on March 14.

    Filipino filmmaker Louie Ignacio’s “Area” is competing for two awards in the Narrative Feature section of the 7th Queens World Film Festival in New York, from March 14 to 19.
    Ignacio is in the running for best director, while lead star Ai-Ai delas Alas is nominated for best actress. The fest’s website describes “Area” as a film “about prostitutes, poverty, politics, redemption and young pimps.”
    Also making its US premiere in Queens is John Day’s animated film, “Matud Nila (According to Them)”—a collection of 24 stories about a small town in the Philippines.

    The 18-minute film recounts “the daily lives, hopes and dreams of Filipinos during World War II.” The fest’s site remarks that the film paints a portrait of “a Philippine community as seen through a filter of memory and imagination.”

    According to the fest’s site, this year’s lineup consists of “tender … heartbreaking films, and several works that are extremely provocative, maybe even disturbing.”
    “Matud Nila (According to Them)”
    The program allows viewers to tap into “the conversations that people are having around the world.” Organizers assert that “the real stars of the festival [are] the films.”
    The fest’s goal is to inspire cineastes “to surrender to the films, without looking for familiar names, titles, scores.” In sum, the fest envisions to “create the right context for personal, intimate films grouped together for a cinematic experience you will not get anywhere else.”—BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    <content>‘I’m Drunk, I Love You’ is what your sober heart needs
    
    
    Photo from I’m Drunk, I Love You Facebook page-
    There is nothing extraordinary about the “friendzone” storyline of JP Habac’s “I’m Drunk, I Love You” (IDILY), but this indie offering is not your typical romantic-comedy flick—something we have not seen on the big screen for a while.
    The film follows the story of graduating kolehiyala Carson (Maja Salvador) who, a few days before her graduation, agreed to accompany her best friend Dio (Paulo Avelino) in a road trip to a La Union beach, despite the risk of missing her graduation rites, to settle some old-as-new and bottled up feelings. This, of course, is just one and the latest in a long list of “acts of martyrdom” Carson would not mind doing for Dio, whom she has been helplessly and hopelessly in love with for seven years. (SEVEN years, baks.)
    IDILY is just on its second week of screening, but it is struggling to stay in cinemas despite rising social media buzz and more and more people wanting to see the film. Theaters showing the film had been reduced to as low as 10 nationwide but climbed back to about 70 due to clamor to bring it back to the screen.

    1. It tells you what you need and deserve to hear.
    While there is nothing exceptional to its girl-falls-in-love-with-best-friend plot, IDILY separates itself from similar-themed movies through its organic and straightforward storytelling. Without resorting to cheap antics like overly cheesy lines and unnecessary humor or drama, the film refuses to dumb down its viewers and presents nothing short of a raw dose of reality that everyone can relate to, maybe even those who have not experienced the same heartbreak.
    With lines like “Ikaw na lang ang umaasa, pati pag-asa nag-give up na sa’yo (You’re the only one still hoping, even hope has given up on you)” and “Hindi mo naman kasalanan kung hindi mo ‘ko mahal (It’s not your fault if you don’t love me),” IDILY does not force to display fireworks on the surface, but rather stirs its viewers from within. But aside from the natural delivery of dialogues, the beauty of the film also resides in its quiet moments, when the silence and the music did the talking for the characters.
    2. It is a story for the millennials and everyone who feels lost
    After spending seven years in college, Carson and Dio are set to go out to the “real world” and pursue careers not necessarily in line with their passion for the arts, mainly motivated by the desire to please and pay back their parents.
    Amid all its emotional whirlwind, IDILY is not just a story for the friendzoned, but for everyone who feels stuck, lost and unsure of what the future holds for them, afraid of stepping out of their comfort zones, and anxious over getting left behind in a fast-paced and success-obsessed environment. It is about being young and carefree at one point, and facing the music to man up when it’s high time.

    3. Maja Salvador, just because
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    We have seen Maja Salvador from her supporting and lead roles in teleseryes and drama anthologies, her portrayal in John Lloyd-Bea flicks, up to her Urian-acclaimed performance in the 2011 film “Thelma,” but her role as Carson is nothing like her previous ones. IDILY is Maja Salvador at her best and most natural, like we’ve never seen her before. Every line is as believable as it gets, and the film could not have made an impact of that magnitude if not for Maja’s realistic delivery that makes her almost inseparable from Carson.
    The film will make you want to sympathize with her, and despite knowing better, will make you want to ride on her “Seven Years A Slave” crusade—for what it’s worth—and be that somebody for someone. It will make you want to go on long rides and listen to or write good music, drink beer and eat bagnet by the beach with your best friends.
    4. Jerrold Tarog’s “Angelito”
    Don’t panic: You have not entered the wrong cinema. Watching IDILY is like watching two films for the price of one, as Jerrold Tarog’s 20-minute short “Angelito” is also being shown before the film itself. Angelito connects the events of the Tarog’s successful historical film “Heneral Luna” to the upcoming sequel “Goyo” (Hen. Gregorio del Pilar) in 2018 also starring Paulo Avelino.
    Differentiating idols from leaders and mere allegiances from principles, Angelito does not only give a preview of “Goyo,” but also offers wisdom amid the present political landscape and what church leaders have called as “reign of terror” under the Duterte administration.

    5. It celebrates all kinds of love and shows that being best friends is not “just friends”
    One of the most beautiful parts of the film is its resolution–which not everyone is particularly happy with–when Carson, side by side the man she has been crazy about, is finally able to say to herself “Graduate na ako!” after seven years of studying and repressing her feelings. She is ecstatic not because she stopped keeping her hopes up, but because she has learned to accept and appreciate things as they are, and finally mustered the courage to move forward from there. The film tells us that being best friends is not being “just friends,” and that it is not less significant than being a couple. It tells us, through beer and good music, that sometimes, true friendship is rarer and more precious than any romantic relationship.
    It celebrates other kinds of love, and refuses to portray one as superior to the other. It is easily relatable, even if we are not exactly in the characters’ shoes, because it shows us part of ourselves and people we know that we have yet to discover—a Carson that will always go home and crash into her mother’s arms at the end of the day, a go-to Jason Ty that will also need other people to be the best friend for him, and a Dio that will always come rushing back to an old love after all these years.
    Catch IDILY in over 70 theaters nationwide. CDG

    <content>Two films on PH in San Francisco
    
    
    Kohki Hasei’s “Blanka”
    Two films, directed by foreigners but featuring Filipino stories, are included in the lineup of the CAAMFest, spearheaded by the Center for Asian American Media, in San Francisco, California. Previously known as the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, the CAAMFest will be held from March 9 to 19.
    Malaysian filmmaker Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards” and Japanese director Kohki Hasei’s “Blanka” will be shown at the CAAMFest, considered the “largest showcase for new Asian-American and Asian films” in the United States.
    In the fest’s website, critic Jason Nou describes Liew’s film as “a dramatic story with imaginative elements that detail the hardship musicians endure on and off the stage.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Nou praises the performance of the lead actor, Filipino rock icon Pepe Smith: It “adds authenticity and self-ridicule, [in light of his] experience in the music industry. Smith’s fans will surely enjoy watching his music come alive on the big screen.”

    Meanwhile, critic Cher Padua calls “Blanka” a “picaresque tale” about a “hardened street kid” played by Filipino YouTube sensation Cydel Gabutero in her big-screen debut. Padua sums up the film as “a wistful exploration of the realities of slum life without being weighed down by melodrama.”
    The Center for Asian American Media is “a nonprofit organization dedicated to presenting stories that convey the richness and diversity of Asian-American experiences to the broadest audience possible.”

    Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz’s Venice-winning “Ang Babaeng Humayo” finally had its premiere in the United States — at the Francesca Beale Theater in New York and under the auspices of the Lincoln Film Society, no less.
    The screening was held on Feb. 18, as a preview of the scheduled run at the Lincoln Film Society on May 19.
    The Lincoln Film Society’s website describes this “Tolstoy-inspired epic…[as a] story of revenge deferred.” The site also quotes Film Comment critic Olaf Moller, who hails “Humayo” as “a meditation on the nature of Goodness in a world of deceit and corruption.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The site asserts that the film “functions as a slow-build tale of urban theater and class warfare, and a sensitive expression of family and forgiveness.”

    “Humayo,” which won the Golden Lion at the Venice film fest last September, will also be shown at the Harvard Film Archive on March 4.
    On the Harvard website, critic Haden Guest calls “Humayo” a “magnum opus…a formally stunning durational epic of resistance that uses its extended length to render vivid the hard struggle for dignity and survival fought by Filipinos during the long…brutal reign of the Marcoses.”
    While “Humayo” marks Diaz’s return to familiar territory previously and “powerfully explored” in acclaimed masterpieces like “Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino” (2004) and “Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon” (2014), it also evinces a distinct departure “from the choral and multicharacter focus” of his other films.
    According to Guest, “Humayo” allows veteran actress Charo Santos-Concio to take “mesmerizing center stage,” delivering “an iconic performance” in the process. The critic praises Concio’s portrayal as “a moving emblem of the long-suffering country.”
    He points out that Concio’s “brave heroine gives hope that the most marginalized victims might find the strength to rise and challenge, and perhaps even change, the abuse of power that continues to destroy lives and livelihoods, not only in the Philippines, but also in all countries, the US included, now twisted by the new rise of fascist demagoguery.”
    Guest remarks that Diaz “again poignantly demonstrates the unique history lessons that cinema alone can teach, not by restaging known, recorded events, but by patiently evoking the quotidian, quiet resistance of citizens unwilling to ignore injustice and indignity.”
    Diaz, who is a fellow of the Radcliffe-Film Study Center at Harvard, will present and discuss the film at the screening.

    Iza Calzado in “Bliss”
    The Philippines is well-represented, with nine movies included in three categories of the 12th Osaka Asian Film Festival, to be held in Japan, from March 3 to 12.
    Vying for top prizes in the main competition section are Jerrold Tarog’s “Bliss,” Sigrid Andrea P. Bernardo’s “Kita Kita” and Borgy Torre’s “Tisay.” The Filipino entries are in the running for the Grand Prix and Most Promising Talent honors.
    Mario Cornejo’s well-traveled surfing flick “Apocalypse Child” is part of the Special Program dubbed “In &amp; Out of Work: Looking at Asia through the Prism of Employment.” This section aims to “reveal the true face of Asian societies and cultures through films that depict the labor situation.”

    “We tried to come up with different kinds of films this year,” said Wilson Tieng, chief executive officer of Solar Entertainment, main proponent of the 3-year-old film festival.
    “Apart from newcomers, we also opened up the fest to veterans,” Cannes-winning filmmaker and festival director Brillante Ma Mendoza told the Inquirer in an exclusive interview.

    There are three categories in this year’s fest: feature-length, shorts and documentaries.
    Among the entries in the feature section are HF Yambao’s “Kristo,” Ricardo Carranza’s “Beyond the Block,” Jason Orfalas’ “Ladyfish,” Joel Lamangan’s “Bhoy Intsik,” and Arnel Barbarona’s “Tu Pug Imatuy (The Right to Kill).”
    Varied colorful characters take centerstage in this year’s features program: a street vendor/cockfight aficionado, hip-hop dancers, a transgender call-center agent and a gay thief and his young protégé.
    Among the finalists in the short films section are: Matthew Victor Pastor’s “I Am Jupiter, I Am the Biggest Planet”; Emmanuel Escalona Jr.’s “Ang Langit, Burger at ang Universe”; Karl Glenn Barit’s “Aliens Ata”; Jose Maria Javier Manoos’ “Ang Hindi Ko Masambit,” and Paul Arrenze Dionela’s “Tulay Buhay.”
    The entries in the documentary category are: Avelino Mark Balmes Jr.’s “Hango”; Jaynus Olaivar’s “Kupkop”; Noah del Rosario’s “The Recycled Spirits of Roel Cabato”; Jean Clare Dy and Manuel Domes’ “Pagrara Sang Patipuron (Weaving a Circle),” and “Krudo Boys” (which is a collaboration among six people: Mirielle de Lara, Angelica Domingo, Dannieleth Julapong, Maria Agnes Malvar, Bea San Juan, Nathaniel Santiago).
    Story-driven
    These short films and docus, Mendoza and Tieng pointed out, would take viewers all over the country, showcasing the lives of ordinary and extraordinary Filipinos.
    For example, “Hango” tells the story of fisherfolk from Bacoor, Cavite.

    “Krudo Boys” follows scavengers who risk life and limb to recover crude oil that leak from ships in Navotas.
    On the other hand, “The Recycled Spirits of Roel Cabato” focuses on an Ilocano-Ifugao artist and environmentalist from Baguio City, while “Pagrara Sang Patipuron” centers on a group of Aeta women from Iloilo.
    “All these films are story-driven,” Tieng remarked. “We put a high premium on the script.”
    The fest will be shown in select cinemas from March 9 to 14. Awards night is on March 12.

    <content>Why Filipino film ‘Ma’ Rosa’ didn’t make it to the Oscars
    
    
    Jaclyn Jose in “Ma’ Rosa”
    NAGA CITY—Despite earning the Cannes best actress award for Jaclyn Jose last year, Brillante Mendoza’s film “Ma’ Rosa” failed to earn a slot on the 89th Oscar Awards’ Foreign Language film category.
    The Academy of Motion Pictures and Arts and Sciences announced the five nominees for Foreign Language: “Tanna,” Australia; “Land of Mine,” Denmark; “Toni Erdmann,” Germany; “The Salesman,” Iran; and “A Man Called Ove,” Sweden.
    Why did “Ma’ Rosa” fail to make it to the nomination for the Oscars, which would honor the best films of 2016 on Feb. 26?
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Mendoza, who came to this city to promote the provincial run of his films, noted the “very big challenge” to surmount not only for the filmmaker but also for the country sending an entry to the Oscars.

    He said he went to the United States with the help of the Film Academy of the Philippines and the Film Development Council of the Philippines, which provided him with P1 million to promote “Ma’ Rosa.”
    “It was paid to one publicity team in America, but it was not enough because the campaign to promote the film in the Oscars is a long one,” Mendoza said of the government assistance.
    For an Oscar entry to get enough exposure to earn a nomination is P5 million at the minimum, Mendoza said.
    He said that for a small country like the Philippines to make it to the annual Academy Awards, one must learn not only to choose the film entry but also to promote and campaign for that chosen entry.
    He said the competition in the Foreign Language category involves more than 80 entries from different countries.
    “It is like the Miss Universe contest,” Mendoza said. “This is the Miss Universe for films, with every participating country having its own way of campaigning and promoting its film to be shortlisted.”
    He said he had to reach out to some 5,000 members of the Academy for Motion Pictures and Arts and Sciences, who will vote for the film nomination.

    Mendoza said that because of these challenges, his entry only reached the first stage of the three-stage nomination process.
    “In these three stages, your film must reach the 5,000 Academy members so that they will understand and know what your film is all about,” he said.
    “You need to produce so many promotional materials like DVDs and reviews of your film, where it has already been shown,” he said.

    <content>Two PH films in Glasgow
    
    
    Charo Santos in “Ang Babaeng Humayo”
    Two Filipino films will be screened at the Glasgow Film Festival, which will be held in Scotland, from Feb. 15 to 26.
    Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards” is included in the Sound &amp; Vision section, while Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” is part of the CineMasters category.
    Producer Bianca Balbuena related that Glasgow is the 13th festival of “Singing in Graveyards,” after its premiere in Venice last year.

    According to the Glasgow fest site, the Sound &amp; Vision section features “stunning live sonic cinema… captivating true stories and unique narratives… the best from the world of music and film.”

    The site points out that lead actor, rock icon Pepe Smith, portrays the central character/s in Liew’s film “with a mixture of sad obsession and acceptance.” Smith’s performance is hailed as “mesmerizing” and Liew’s debut film as “moving.”
    The screenings of Liew’s film are on Feb. 19 and 23.
    Meanwhile, Diaz’s “latest masterly work” is part of a section that celebrates “the best of the best.”
    The fest site points out that the films in Diaz’s section are “handcrafted by masters of the cinematic arts.”
    Organizers note that these “masters” are “world-class talents who have painstakingly studied their profession, learned from past failures and gone from strength to strength in careers that now stand as inspirational.”
    Also included in the CineMasters lineup are films by François Ozon (“Frantz”) and Paul Verhoeven (“Elle”).
    According to the site, what these diverse auteurs have in common is that they are “always part of the awards season conversation, constantly collecting prizes from the finest film festivals in the world, and sometimes so admired that their names have become adjectives.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The fest’s site praises “Humayo,” which won the Golden Lion in last year’s Venice fest, as “a lyrical, transcendent epic unfolding in glorious black and white.”
    The site likewise quotes Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw who describes “Humayo” as “a vast, dark behemoth of mystery and anguish, as forbidding as a starless night sky.”
    Diaz’s film will be shown on Feb. 16 and 17 in Glasgow.

    On the set in Marinduque (from left): Alessandra de Rossi, JC Santos and director Ice Idanan
    Ice Idanan at the CineFilipino awards—Richard Reyes
    Even well-meaning friends cautioned debuting director Ice Idanan about her plan to shoot her first film, “Sakaling Hindi Makarating,” all over the archipelago.
    Fortunately, she didn’t listen to the worrywarts.
    “Many advised me to let go of some of the locations, but I wanted to keep them because they were essential to the story,” explained Idanan, who previously worked as cinematographer in different projects.

    An entry in last year’s CineFilipino Film Festival, Idanan’s first full-length feature tells the story of a despondent woman, played by Alessandra de Rossi, who travels from south to north, in search of a mysterious letter writer.

    Idanan shot in five provinces: Zamboanga, Siquijor, Marinduque, Ilocos Norte and Batanes. “I chose places that weren’t usually visited by tourists,” she poined out. “I also wanted to break some misconceptions that people had about those areas, especially Zamboanga.”
    Pressed to single out a favorite among the five places, Idanan seemed reluctant at first. “Honestly, it’s hard to pick, but Batanes definitely stood out because of the peace and tranquility that it offers to travelers. I was very inspired to create while we were filming there.”
    It was hardly a pleasure trip, though. Traveling, she concedes, was the “biggest challenge” of the production.
    “We had to go to each location with a skeleton crew of 10 to 15 people, including actors,” she recalls. “It was an adventure talaga.”
    In spite of the frayed nerves, it was all worth it because each stop offered fresh insights. “I discovered that, despite distance and the differences in culture and tradition, no matter where you go in the Philippines, you will always be treated like family,” she asserted.
    It also helped that the director had previously worked with the lead star.
    “It was my fourth time to work with Alex,” Idanan reports. “I was a cinematographer in Keith Sicat’s ‘Woman of the Ruins’ and worked on Alex’s music videos for ‘Make It Better’ and ‘Storm.’”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    She had nothing but praise for the actress. “Alex understands her craft so well and was very collaborative. I was lucky that we had already established rapport, making it easier for a first-time director to work with a pro like her.”
    In a way, Idanan had plenty of practice prior to filming, having embarked on a similar soul-searching journey herself.
    “I wrote the script in 2011, after a massive heartbreak,” she recounted. “I had so many feelings back then and didn’t know how else to express them, so I decided to write a movie.”
    The cathartic exercise eventually yielded seven CineFilipino trophies—including best director and cinematographer for Idanan.
    She said she keeps her best director award at her parents’ house. “To remind my parents that I’m always working hard to make them proud,” she volunteered. “CineFilipino has helped me develop confidence…and [has made me realize that] even young directors can make films.”
    Just in time for Valentine’s, her little film is a “labor of love” on life, loss and letting go. “I believe that there are many kinds of love, but the most important kind is love for oneself,” she quipped. “This story aims to remind us that.”
    Idanan hoped Filipino audiences would likewise show some love to her film, which opens in cinemas on Feb. 1. “I hope they will welcome it with open arms. Love is universal, after all.”
    Releasing an “indie” film in cineplexes is still an uphill climb, she admitted. “I make films so I can share them with people. All films must be given the chance to be shown in regular cinemas.”
    Alessandra de Rossi in “Sakaling Hindi Makarating”
    She acknowledged that there are daunting challenges ahead for new filmmakers like her. “Getting theaters to believe that your film can sell is a different ball game. Sometimes, rejection can make us question ourselves.”
    Times, however, are a-changing, making her more optimistic. “We’re lucky that cinemas are now more open—given the attention received by Filipino filmmakers here and abroad,” she said. “There should be an open discussion [of the issues] and everyone should keep an open mind. We should look beyond the ‘indie’ and ‘mainstream’ labels. Films are films, and they are meant to be shared.”

    Filipino films were mentioned as among the best movies of 2016 in a forum conducted by the British Film Institute’s Sight and Sound magazine among 163 critics and curators from all over the world.
    Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo,” Golden Lion winner at last year’s Venice Film Festival, placed 31st on the list, garnering five votes from the panel of experts.
    Also chosen by some respondents were two other Diaz films: “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis” (which won the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize in the Berlinale 2016) and “Ang Araw Bago ang Wakas” (which won top prizes in Oberhausen, Germany, and Zabok, Croatia, last year).

    Rithdee notes: “Duterte or not, senseless deaths on the street or not, Diaz never tries to catch a rabbit—he always goes for the dragon in its lair.”
    But beyond the grand themes of revenge and redemption, Rithdee remarks that “in this film, what moves us even more is the possibility of mercy, compassion, even grace, struggling to blossom like a flower in hell.”
    British critic Derek Malcolm similarly praises “Humayo”: “The more I think about it, the more I admire the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at Venice. [It] is a film that lives in the memory as a moral, political and cultural statement, as well as a fine piece of filmmaking.”
    Jonathan Romney, Malcolm’s colleague and compatriot, agrees: “My vote [for “Humayo”] is also a vote for an exemplary continuing adventure in filmmaking as passionate mission.”
    Alexander Horwath, director of the Austrian Film Museum, also had “Humayo” on his Top 5—a list he collectively describes as “avatars of our present condition.”
    Writer, blogger and teacher Jonathan Rosenbaum from the United States put Diaz’s short film “Ang Araw Bago ang Wakas” on top of his list.

    Two of Diaz’s films, “Humayo” and “Hele,” made it on the list of critic Noel Vera of the Philippines. US critic and programmer Jordan Cronk likewise chose “Hele” as part of his extended lineup of “honorable mentions.”

    Two panelists picked Brillante Ma Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa.”
    James Quandt, curator and critic from Canada, included “Ma’ Rosa” in his Top 5. French critic and academician Jean-Michel Frodon, on the other hand, included “Ma’ Rosa” as part of his extended list of Top 15 films.

    Following the success of independent films in the revamped Metro Manila Film Festival, the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) and SM Cinema have inked a three-year partnership to give local independent films more exposure in commercial theaters.
    Under the agreement which was signed Saturday, SM cinema will provide eight theaters nationwide that will screen independent films all throughout the year. Participating branches include SM Megamall, SM North Edsa, SM Fairview, SM Iloilo, SM Southmall, SM Cebu, SM Bacoor and SM Mall of Asia (or SM Davao or SM Lanang). It will take effect on the first half of the year.
    FDCP chair Liza Diño said the partnership would give independent film producers “a platform to learn how to market, to promote, and to distribute their films to wider audience.”

    “It is a known fact that independent filmmakers face many challenges including preconceived notions but everyone agrees that many of our talented directors and actors started out in independent films and so there is indeed a need to nurture and support them by giving their films more exposure, more venues to reach more people,” Diño said in a statement.

    “From the very start, FDCP’s approach is engaging the entire film community through collaboration. FDCP believes that all sectors from the filmmakers to the audience are stakeholders in the growth of our creative industry,” she added.
    SM Lifestyle Entertainment Inc. president Edgar Tejerero said the partnership was a way of showing support to the local film industry.
    “We believe in nurturing our independent movie producers and recognize the effort and creativity they put in their work despite the financial challenges. This is our way of helping them show their films to a wider audience because we believe in their talent and the work that they do for the local movie industry,” Tejerero said. IDL

    A Filipino filmmaker will premiere this week in Tel Aviv his documentary on how the Philippines provided refuge to some 1,300 Jews fleeing from the Holocaust.
    According to Philippine ambassador to Israel Neal Imperial, “An Open Door: Holocaust Haven in the Philippines” by Noel Izon will be shown at the Cinematheque Tel Aviv on Jan. 25.

    Izon’s film is about how the Philippines, under President Manuel L. Quezon, saved some 1,300 European Jews from the Holocaust.
    President Quezon, the envoy said, worked with Jewish networks in Manila from the 1930s to 1941 to provide visas and shelter to the European refugees most of whom became “Manilaners,” making the Philippines their home.
    He said that the late President’s open-door policy for Jewish refugees is a significant aspect of Philippine-Israel relations.
    The premiere of the documentary is a joint project of the Philippine Embassy in Israel, the American Jewish Committee Asia Pacific Institute and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.
    Following the advanced screening, Izon as well as coproducer and Humanities scholar Sharon Delmendo and Holocaust scholar and researcher Bonnie Harris will join a panel discussion, which will also be participated in by two surviving Manilaners—Max Weissler and Margot Pins Kestenbaum.

    “The Sister”
    Two Filipino films will be featured in the Black Movie International Independent Film Festival ongoing in Geneva, Switzerland, until Jan. 29.
    Included in the “To Be Followed” section, Joseph Israel Laban’s “The Sister” is competing for two honors: the Critics’ Award and the Audience Prize. The Black Movie website describes the “To Be Followed” category as “the festival’s beacon section.”
    In “The Sister,” a woman repatriates the body of her sibling, who worked as a domestic helper abroad, in the middle of the Moriones festival in Marinduque.
    ADVERTISEMENT

    It commends the film for giving viewers a glimpse of “the astonishing Moriones” tradition, which happens on a “heavenly Filipino island” and for the “bewitching original soundtrack.”
    “The Sister” previously brought home prizes from two international film festivals: best cinematography (for Marco Felipe Villas Lopez) in Harlem and best actress (for Sue Prado) in Guam. It also competed at the Dhaka International Film Festival in Bangladesh.
    Meanwhile, Pepe Diokno’s “Kapatiran” is included in the Black Movie fest’s “Abuse of Power” category.
    “Kapatiran,” which exposes the violent initiation practices in an elitist law school, “illustrates the corruption of clan-ruled Manila.”
    This section features “directors [who] pinpoint excesses of power in all shapes and sizes, from general to individual corruption, from arbitrary decision-making to influence peddling.”
    The Black Movie event is a “pioneering film festival with no hang-ups.” According to its site, the fest “resolutely swims against the tide of conventional movie fare.”
    The 10-day festival, which features emerging talents and established filmmakers from Asia, Africa and Latin America, aims “to reflect current aesthetic and social trends via a thematic approach.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    It explains that “each section is organized around social topics or current affairs, popular cinema, new urban cultures, genres or filmmakers.” It likewise presents a section that is especially dedicated to children.

    Brillante Ma Mendoza—JOHN PAUL R.AUTOR
    Even Cannes-winning filmmaker Brillante Ma Mendoza experiences setbacks when making independently produced films.
    “There will always be situations you can’t control. You just have to learn to adapt. If you’re easily discouraged, you’ll end up with nothing,” said Mendoza, who has 13 movies under his belt, the most recent of which was “Ma’ Rosa.” The film, which tackles drug trafficking and police brutality, won for lead star Jaclyn Jose the best actress award at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival in France.
    Mendoza added: “From the time I made my first film (2005’s “Masahista”) to my latest, I say nothing much has changed. Making movies in the Philippines is still extremely challenging. It isn’t for the fainthearted.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    In fact, a producer of “Ma’ Rosa” backed out just before he began shooting. Mendoza said the same thing happened to “Thy Womb” (2012), his film with superstar Nora Aunor that was shot in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi. “Eventually, I was able to find another producer, but it wasn’t easy. I had to learn to adjust. I make sure to always deliver, even if I have to borrow money or invest in the project myself.”

    “Thirteen films later, the struggles in making a film are the same. It’s just a matter of acknowledging that you’re a filmmaker from a developing country,” Mendoza pointed out.
    Creating an audience for the kind of films he has been making is another hurdle that Mendoza said he has to overcome. “If I keep giving the audience only what they want and not what they need, I’d be just one of those filmmakers,” he pointed out. “You don’t need to compromise your methods and aesthetics to please an audience. Listen to your gut. Give them something that will disturb them and encourage critical thinking.”
    What drove Mendoza into doing films that he said were “not just meant to entertain,” was his need to “break the mainstream mold.” He explained: “As a storyteller, I realized that I have a responsibility to educate the Filipino audience. There’s more to filmmaking than the prestige of working with famous actors. It’s that knowledge that pushed me to create films that I hoped have set me apart from other directors.”
    “Masahista,” starring a young Coco Martin—now one of ABS-CBN’s top actors—is about a man trying to survive poverty by offering massages and sexual favors. This was followed by “Kaleldo” (2006), a thought-provoking film on a dysfunctional family.
    Mendoza went on to make masterpieces like “Serbis,” “Lola,” “Captive” and “Taklub” that drew rave reviews in international film festivals. “Kinatay,” about a criminology student who joins a crime syndicate to earn money for his young family, eventually won for him the best director award in 2009, also at the prestigious Cannes film fest.
    “I am inspired by issues and problems that I see around me. I base my stories on real-life situations,” he shared with the Inquirer. “Some of my films are inspired by news items either from television or the newspaper.”
    That was why, Mendoza said, he didn’t have any second thoughts when the Inquirer tapped him to be one of its brand ambassadors for the recently launched #MyINQUIRER campaign, highlighting the new media quintet experience. “It’s all about credibility. I don’t mind being associated with a credible company,” he stressed.

    “I remember how happy it made me to see my photo on the paper’s front page when I won in Cannes. There are only two ways to land on the front page—either you do something really bad or perform beyond everyone else’s expectations,” Mendoza pointed out. “It makes me feel proud that a credible newspaper is writing about my achievements. A group of foreign journalists who interviewed me at an international film fest said they know what I have been doing here because they have read the Inquirer.”
    Mendoza is also cofounder of the three-year-old Sinag Maynila film festival, created to pay tribute to the creative minds of local independent cinema.
    Speaking as a Filipino icon, Mendoza said he hoped Filipinos would do away with crab mentality and aspire for a “principled and dignified” life. He added that as a filmmaker, “I can only do so much. In fact, I don’t believe that my films can change the world or the Filipino nation. I promise to always be committed to doing the kind of films I am now making, and I will keep doing them well.”

    Presented by the Hong Kong International Film Festival Society, AFA seeks to “recognize excellence among film professionals” in the region. This year’s ceremony will be held on March 21 in Hong Kong. In 1978, Santos won best actress at the Asian Film Festival for her debut, Mike de Leon’s “Itim.” —BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    When you cast the right actors, half of your work is already done,” said independent filmmaker Nerissa Picadizo.
    She recently announced that Jake Cuenca and Anna Luna will be playing the lead characters of her first full-length movie, “Requited.”
    The film, “a love story with splashes of biking adventure,” is one of the 10 entries in the 2017 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival in August.

    “I will draw emotion from them throughout the film. If they don’t have the drive and passion, I won’t get anything out of them even if I wring them dry,” said Picadizo on the importance of finding the right people to play the roles of Matt and Sandy.

    “Requited” tells of a disease-stricken biker who wants to conquer a treacherous terrain on one final adventure that pits him against nature and the woman he desires.
    Picadizo said she wrote the script with Cuenca in mind. “We first met at the 2014 Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards, where I told him about the story, and he reacted positively to it,” she recalled.
    Nerissa Picadizo and Jake Cuenca
    The Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards is an annual gathering of key personalities in the indie filmmaking scene to honor those who have won awards in international film festivals. Picadizo (for “Astray”) and Cuenca (for “Mulat”) were in the same batch of honorees.
    “Whenever I would listen to ‘Safe and Sound,’ the song that served as an inspiration for the finale of this film, Jake appears in my mind as Matt,” she shared with the Inquirer. “I’m happy he said ‘yes’ to the film.”
    Picadizo said she believed Cuenca would have a lot to contribute to the film. “I also see in him the need to prove himself as a great actor. I’m glad that a mainstream actor like him is very open and willing to take chances on an independent film. I guess if he really likes a project, then the talent fee is not an issue to him,” she pointed out.
    The filmmaker added that there were several indie actresses who auditioned for the part of Sandy, but “only Anna captured that feisty charm I was looking for in the character. When I saw her perform at the auditions, I knew I found the right actress [to play the part],” Picadizo said. “I always cast actors based on what my instinct tells me.”
    Picadizo pointed out that Luna is not a newbie when it comes to acting—she has won two best supporting actress awards: “Bendor,” 2014 Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival; “Paglipay,” 2016 ToFarm Film Festival).

    She explained that the film has three themes: “unrequited love, health struggles and man’s deep need to move on,” all based on her personal struggles. “I wrote it to release all the pent-up emotions I can’t normally express, hoping that I can understand myself better and eventually find healing.
    For Picadizo, the Cinemalaya nod felt like earning a badge of credibility as a filmmaker because her work was chosen out of the hundreds of entries submitted last year.

    Senate Majority Leader Vicente “Tito” Sotto III wants a film festival exclusive to independent films only.
    In Senate Resolution No. 257 he filed on Thursday, Sotto proposed that the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) should establish a film festival “exclusively for the independent films during the long semestral break.”
    He pointed out that this year, the independent movies have dominated the annual Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) because of its new criteria for choosing the final 8 films to be shown in the cinemas.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    In the new criteria, Sotto said, the 50% previously allotted to “commercial viability” had been removed.

    “The dominance of independent films in the 42nd MMFF stirred discussions in social media and in the movie industry. While these independent films are considered by some as ‘breath of fresh air from the usual funny, fantastical storylines,’ and ‘encourage people to think,’ most of the regular MMFF moviegoers are still looking for the kinds of films screened in the previous MMFFs—movies that give them a good laugh,” the senator said in the resolution.
    “Since Christmas season is for children, and it is likewise the time when MMFF movies are being shown in the cinemas, the absence of the mainstream films in the MMFF entries for 2016 was prejudicial to the regular MMFF moviegoers, particularly the children, who always look forward to these movies to bond, enjoy, be entertained and share a good laugh with their family and friends,” he said.
    While the 2016 MMFF entries were mostly independent films, Sotto said, the audience turnout has been low, prompting a number of theaters to drop some films from its list of movies being screened.
    READ: MMFF movies to be shown in selected theaters until Jan. 7
    And because of the low earning’s from this year’s entries, the MMFF’s mandate to promote the welfare of its workers had also been “somewhat brushed aside,” the senator said.
    Sotto, nevertheless, recognized the contribution of the independent films in the Philippine movie industry, noting that some of them had been nominated and received numerous awards in different well-regarded international film festivals.
    “Independent films must likewise be given its well-deserved spotlight—separate from the mainstream films that can take or divide the attention from them—from the public in general,” he said. RAM

    Now, we know why the women of Baby Ruth Villarama’s landmark documentary, “Sunday Beauty Queen,” deserve to be “stars” not just on weekends, but every day of the week.
    Three of the docu’s featured Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)—Leo Selomenio, Hazel Perdido and Mylyn Jacobo—visited the Inquirer between cinema tours and suit/gown fittings last week.

    Without skipping a beat, the three discussed their past, present and future with the same candor and humor evident in the documentary—an entry in this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival. (The docu won best picture, Gatpuno Antonio J. Villegas Cultural Award and best editing at the MMFF.)
    They excitedly talked about meeting stars like Nora Aunor and Ricky Davao at the parade and giddily wished for a selfie with MMFF juror John Lloyd Cruz.

    The film has had an uncanny effect on viewers who wholeheartedly embraced its characters.
    On the day of the Inquirer visit, a fan (a former OFW himself) met up with them to hand over a check—his donation to the Berthune House (for troubled migrant workers).
    Designer Bessie Besana, who also worked in Hong Kong like the Queens, volunteered to make gowns for the ladies’ awards night appearance.
    On its second week, the film is still being showered with spontaneous support from netizens—who are steadily campaigning to keep the docu in cinemas.
    There was always the looming danger of being pulled out (at the start, it was not even shown in some provinces). But the Queens remained gracious even under tremendous pressure—exemplifying the quiet resolve and resilience of Filipinos everywhere.

    It’s been an uphill climb so far, but as these OFWs know only too well: The taste of tears makes each triumph sweeter.
    What’s it like meeting the viewers in the theaters?
    Leo Selomenio (LS): We feel like stars! They mob us. They ask for photos with us. They ask about Mommy.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    How’s Mommy?
    LS: OK lang. Every time people see me in theater lobbies, they ask: “Where’s Mommy?” She is in Hong Kong. She hasn’t seen the docu yet. We hope to have a screening in Hong Kong soon.
    Was it hard revealing so much of yourselves in the film?
    LS: Not really. It was just like an ordinary working day for us. The only difference was that a crew was following us around. I felt like “Dora the Explorer,” walking all over Hong Kong with my backpack. That’s my life. I never rest.
    What led you to pageant organizing?
    LS: I used to hang out in karaoke bars. It was a bad scene—people got drunk or got involved in fights. After a while, I got fed up. I felt like we were liabilities in Hong Kong. I told my lesbian friends: Let’s get out of this zone.
    So we formed an organization: Kabisig. We organized a contest for lesbians: Chick Boy. Then, other groups joined us. Eventually, it became a pageant for female domestic helpers.
    How were you able to charm your boss, TV-film producer Jack Soo, who seemed so strict?
    Mylyn Jacobo (MJ): His former helpers were Chinese. I was his first Filipino helper. He said he always wanted an assistant from the Philippines. He chose me from among 40 applicants. He was a perfectionist…very moody and scary!
    I later learned he didn’t like helpers who kept frowning. Good thing, I was always cheerful! He seldom smiled, but he said he was happy inside. He never scolded me. He later told me that he felt blessed to have me. Sometimes, he’d request for Singaporean dishes. So I would Google recipes. His children called me: “Dad’s Angel.” He treated me like a real daughter.
    One of the highlights was Hazel, watching her son’s graduation on the phone.
    Baby Ruth Villarama (BV): We cried while shooting it.
    Hazel Perdido (HP): My son asked me why I wasn’t able to go home for his graduation. I explained to him that I had to take care of my employer’s dog. He was upset.
    But your son got to watch the docu with you recently?
    HP: Now, my eldest understands me more. Now, he always asks me where I am going. We became closer. He would always check on me. Then, he would tell me: Why are you still out? It’s already late! I have three boys: 12, 11 and 9.
    Does working abroad really make your lives better?
    LS: Oo naman!
    MJ: Financially, but not emotionally.
    Some OFWs are not able to save for the future?
    LS: Maybe they don’t know how to manage their time and earnings. Apart from my main job, I also do part-time work for the consulate and other people. I feel like St. Peter; my bag is filled with keys to the places where I work part-time.
    Will the film help change people’s perception about domestic helpers?
    MJ: Since I got back home, I was able to see the differences then and now. Before, I only wanted to earn. I was able to save, but I had to send four siblings to school. I helped my brother take up his masters’ degree in marine engineering, but he soon got married. I got hurt because I thought they didn’t value my hard work. I hope this movie will teach people to appreciate OFWs more.
    On Facebook, we post photos of pageants… we’re always laughing and happy. We wouldn’t want to show our hardship. We don’t want our batchmates to think we are suffering, pushing a kariton. But now, I am no longer ashamed about being an OFW.
    Why didn’t you feature serious abuses like rape and other violent crimes committed against OFWs?
    BV: That is not the direction we wanted to take. We wanted to promote empathy. Those cases are already being tackled on TV. I wanted people to understand and appreciate them as OFWs.
    What was your reaction when you were told about being part of the docu?
    HP: I shared it with my friends. They told me that I’d get to walk down the red carpet. I asked my new employer if I could spend Christmas in the Philippines. It was perfect timing for the MMFF, too.
    LS: Okay lang sa akin. My relatives got to see it in Iloilo. The film wasn’t supposed to be shown there. I cried in front of the mayor’s secretary to help us get theaters in my hometown.
    I was then set to receive an award from the mayor. I told them that I won’t accept the trophy if they didn’t help us. I don’t care about the award; my provincemates should get to watch this film.
    How were you able to convince your employer to participate in the docu?
    LS: Before her interview with Direk Baby Ruth, my boss went to the salon to have her hair and makeup done!

    Award-winning indie filmmakers and show biz couple Jun Robles Lana and Perci Intalan will be celebrating Christmas rather differently this year.
    “This will be our first Christmas with our baby, so we’re extremely excited,” said Jun.
    The couple is in the process of adopting a baby boy. “Our lives have changed completely since he arrived. I’m excited to just stay at home and be with him,” Jun said. “He will be turning a year old on Dec. 28, and he is now starting to walk on his own.”

    Jun said he and Perci usually go on trips during the holidays. Their favorite destination is New York City, where they got married in 2013.

    “Suddenly, we’re parents now. We just want to be with him,” he declared.
    Perci added: “Jun would usually spend Christmas and New Year’s Eve with his family, while I would be with mine; we would just call each other, then meet after. The big question now is, where will our boy spend his? I might actually leave my family before Christmas Eve, maybe at 11 p.m., so we can all be together.”
    Just like any other new parents, Jun and Perci are still learning the ropes. “We’re both the type who don’t believe that we should spend so much on a baby’s first birthday because the baby will not remember it, anyway. So, we said we should be practical parents. We’ve decided to just hold the party at a Chinese restaurant—but we want everyone to be in costume, the ‘Kung Fu Panda’ kind. We had to stop ourselves there before the event turns into a big show,” said Perci, laughing.
    Perci insisted that the party would be “very private. It will just be for family since we’re still going through the legal process. At the same time, we don’t want the boy to feel uncomfortable with too many people around. He might get upset.”
    Asked what gifts they’d like to give themselves this year, Perci said: “I really don’t know, but if I were to ask myself for a gift, it would be a trip to a place that’s exotic and quiet. Jun knows that. I dream of going to Bhutan or Argentina.”
    Jun added: “I can’t think of anything material to get myself this year. I want to rest after making two films this year and some projects for our company, IdeaFirst.”
    Their December would be spent promoting Jun’s “Die Beautiful,” said Perci, who produced the film. It is one of the eight entries in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival, which will run from Dec. 25 to Jan. 3.

    “We plan to go around malls on opening day. We can only relax after the awards night on Dec. 29. We’ve also experienced not being able to celebrate New Year, because we worked on ‘Anino sa Likod ng Buwan’ right after Christmas of 2015,” Perci shared with the Inquirer.
    Jun said he was surprised by “Die Beautiful” lead star Paolo Ballesteros’ range as an actor. “I’m confident that when producers see this film, they’ll think of other projects for him to do,” Jun said, adding that he would be working on another film with Paolo in 2017.
    Paolo brought home the best actor trophy from the 2016 Tokyo film fest. The film was given the audience choice award in Tokyo, too. Paolo also won a special mention for outstanding performance citation for “Die Beautiful” at the Kerala fest in India.
    “Die Beautiful” also features Joel Torre, Gladys Reyes, Luis Alandy, Albie Casiño, IC Mendoza, Lou Veloso, with the special participation of Iza Calzado and Eugene Domingo.

    “Hilom”
    A Filipino filmmaker topped the Silver Screen Awards, held in conjunction with the recently concluded Singapore International Film Festival. PR Patindol’s debut film, “Hilom (Still),” won the Youth Jury Prize.
    According to the fest’s site, the Filipino short film was commended for “providing a fresh and innovative perspective of Southeast Asia, while seeking to challenge boundaries of themes and filmmaking techniques.”
    The film tells the story of twin brothers as they confront questions of identity and sexuality.

    Says critic Eliza Poh: “Patindol offers a new way of understanding homosexual love by revealing to us the fine line between brotherly love and romantic love.”

    <content>Drama, comedy, suspense at the Inquirer Indie Bravo!
    
    
    Honorees, guests and the Inquirer Entertainment staff celebrate the country’s “winningest” year in international film festivals.
    Like a riveting, star-studded film, the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards had all the ingredients of a heady brew: drama, comedy, suspense and a bit of romance.
    Cannes best actress Jaclyn Jose kept the crowd in suspense—as she had motored all the way from Quezon City and arrived at almost 9 p.m., just as her name was about to be called as the night’s last honoree.
    She headed straight for the buffet table as she hadn’t eaten since breakfast.

    Her head was spinning; her stomach aching. But she would not dare miss the event. “I could have gone to a drive-thru to pick up some food, but I would have missed the event!” Jaclyn said, eliciting laughter from a room full of talented filmmakers and actors, and staunch movie producers.

    “I needed to be here, because the Inquirer is a paper I admire and respect,” said the veteran artist, who accepted her second Indie Bravo! trophy—this time, for being hailed best actress at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, for her performance in the movie, “Ma’ Rosa.”
    “For me, winning is different from getting recognition. So I make sure to be present at such events,” Jaclyn said of the annual Indie Bravo! celebrations.
    Some expected Paolo Ballesteros, who won the best actor plum at this year’s Tokyo Film Festival for the movie “Die Beautiful,” to make a show-stopping entrance as one of the many Hollywood stars he impersonates through his fabulous makeup transformations.
    But as much as he wanted to, Paolo explained he had to drive himself to the Inquirer. “E, baka matunaw ang makeup at gown!” quipped Paolo, who nonetheless looked dashing in a dark blazer and a plain white shirt. “I now have three acting trophies. Back then, I used to win only titles like ‘Binibining Palaro’ or ‘Miss Cabanatuan!’”
    Inquirer’s Marixi Prieto and Sid Lucero
    Lotlot de Leon gave a heartwarming speech, paying tribute to the veteran directors on the roster: Mel Chionglo, Joel Lamangan and Elwood Perez. “I grew up watching their movies. It’s inspiring to be in the company of greatness.”
    Guyito plush toy
    It was Lotlot’s first time to get a Guyito—and she was nervous. Lotlot received a special acting citation at the All Lights India fest in Hyderabad.
    Perez told the Inquirer: “How wonderful to have lived long enough to witness Inquirer’s seventh night of nights!”

    “Patuloy tayong gumawa ng pelikula—para sa bayan at para sa Guyito!” jested director Jun Robles Lana, whose recognition this year for “Die Beautiful” and “Anino sa Likod ng Buwan,” earned him his fifth Guyito.
    Ferdinand Lapuz and Sue Prado
    Many of this year’s honorees appeared to be more excited about the Guyito plush toy—Inquirer’s carabao mascot—than the trophy itself. It didn’t matter whether it was their first time to get one, or if they already have enough to make a family.
    Producer-professor Rene Durian, who accepted the Indie Bravo! prize on behalf of “Taklub” director Brillante Ma Mendoza—another perennial honoree—said: “Direk can now build a carabao farm!”
    Character actress Cherry Malvar related that, when her daughter, child star Therese Malvar, found out that she had won the best actress award at the Moscow Film Festival for the film “Hamog,” the 15-year-old’s immediate reaction was, “Mommy, I will now get to have a Guyito!”
    “Therese was already thinking about Indie Bravo!, even before she saw her trophy from Moscow,” Cherry said.

    “1st Sem” directors Allan Ibañez and Dexter Hemedez jestingly recalled how they almost ended up in jail because of debts incurred while making the film. But their struggles were rendered insignificant by the sweetness of success, they insisted.
    Unforgettable night
    “The night was unforgettable. Indie Bravo! made us feel special,” Allan said.
    Repeat awardee Sid Lucero said he would never get tired of bringing home a Guyito. He related that he gave his first to his daughter, and his second to his mom. “Maybe I can keep this third one,” he said.
    Another returning honoree, Allen Dizon, likewise shared his award (and his third Guyito) with his families—at home and on the set.
    Producers Fernando Ortigas and EA Rocha, who accepted the award of Mikhail Red for “Birdshot,” expressed the hope that, after the international acclaim, their film will be as well-received by the local audience when it opens next year.
    Jaclyn Jose
    The sentiment was echoed by most of the awardees, whose films will face an uphill climb in local cinemas.
    Inquirer had a home-grown honoree this year: Radyo Inquirer news director Arlyn dela Cruz, who was dubbed by Jaclyn as the “night’s most controversial winner.” (Arlyn recently figured in a scandal involving actor Baron Geisler, who urinated on costar Ping Medina on the set of her latest film, “Bubog.”)
    Liza Diño (left) and Aiza Seguerra
    The honorees also made time to talk about important social issues.
    Honoree Ralston Jover, whose film, “Hamog,” tackles the plight of street children, mentioned the distressing move to “lower the age of criminal liability” in Congress.
    Ara Belleng of Amin Anak Mindanao, who represented documentarian Sheron Dayoc, reiterated the message of their Busan-winning film, “The Crescent Rising.” “We wish that our film will start a dialogue on the issues confronting Southern Philippines.”
    Arlyn dela Cruz
    Film Development Council of the Philippines chair Liza Diño rearranged her calendar, so she could attend the Indie Bravo! Awards with her spouse, singer Aiza Seguerra, who is chair of the National Youth Commission.
    The pioneering celebrity same-sex couple celebrated their second wedding anniversary on the same day as the Indie Bravo! Awards.
    There was also music, provided by singers Mitch Valdes and Ronnie Liang.
    Mitch, who has also appeared in indie films, sang “Balut,” which was dedicated to Inquirer Entertainment columnist Nestor U. Torre. (“Balut” was part of the stage musical, “Katy,” which was directed by Torre and featured Valdes in the title role.) Mitch said the last time she listened to the song’s minus one was 20 years ago.
    Now, for the romance part.
    Joel Lamangan
    Liang, who topbilled Elwood’s “Esoterika: Maynila,” performed “Ngiti”—made popular by the AlDub kalyeserye phenomenon.
    The honorees, who braved the holiday traffic rush to make it in time for the annual festivities held in the paper’s Makati office, truly deserved their trophies and Guyito stuffed toy for the patience and commitment they have shown—all for the love of cinema and the independent film movement.
    Now on its seventh edition, the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards honors filmmakers, actors and other movie industry professionals who have won in international film festivals.
    To celebrate the Inquirer’s 31st anniversary, the Indie Bravo! Awards feted 31 honorees this year—including top winners from A-list festivals like Berlin, Cannes, Shanghai, Moscow, Venice and Tokyo.
    This year, the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards was a multimedia event, covered by Next Video/Inquirer.Net, Inquirer Social (FB Live, Periscope, Twitter and Viber) and Bandera.

    Paolo Ballesteros in “Die Beautiful”
    Apart from Jun Robles Lana’s “Die Beautiful” in the main competition, three other Filipino films will be screened at the 21st International Film Festival of Kerala in India from Dec. 9 to 16.
    Roderick Cabrido’s “Tuos” and Eduardo Roy Jr.’s “Pamilya Ordinaryo” are included in the World Cinema section, while Roy’s “Quick Change” is part of the Gender Bender program.
    The fest’s website describes “Die Beautiful” as a “poignant character study celebrating individuality… [a] look back at the colorful and extraordinary life… [of a transgender as] a son, sister, mother, friend, lover, wife and, ultimately, a queen.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    According to the fest’s site, “Tuos” tells the story of a village seeress who comes “face to face, literally, with the ghosts of tradition, which have shackled her into a life of solitary confinement.”

    “Pamilya Ordinaryo” is summed up as a “family portrait… [of teenaged runaways] who live on their own in the chaotic streets of Manila.”
    “Quick Change” is commended for telling its story “with documentary precision and breathtaking speed.”
    The site points out: “Quick Change” “explores the harsh world of a community obsessed with beauty and improving their chances of a career. Filmed at real locations using a hand-held camera, it portrays a society dancing madly but vulnerably on a volcano.”
    The fest is organized by the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, which aims “to promote cinema.”
    The main tilt gathers films from Asia, Africa and Latin America. “Die Beautiful” is vying for top awards against films from Egypt, Turkey, South Africa, China, Mexico, among other countries.
    The fest’s highest honor, the Golden Crow Pheasant Award, comes with a cash prize of INR 15 lakhs (US$30,000).
    Last year, Lana won best director for “Anino sa Likod ng Buwan” at the Kerala fest.

    <content>Baron Geisler in trouble again over ‘pissing’ scene
    
    
    Baron Geisler
    A word war is ongoing on Facebook between filmmaker Arlyn dela Cruz and actor Baron Geisler over who was accountable for an “untoward incident” that happened on the set of the indie film, “Bubog.”
    Dela Cruz said that what Geisler did was “unacceptable and cannot be justified by any claim of (an actor) being in character,” but Geisler insisted that everything was just a “misunderstanding.”
    The director claimed that she has repeatedly explained to Geisler what he should do and that it was written “clearly” on the script “where (Baron’s) character (was) coming from, and how I wanted it to be tackled.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Geisler insisted that he has attempted to talk with Dela Cruz three times to tell her what he had planned to do, but the director merely told him to “just do it while filming the scene.”

    This was why Geisler just went on and pissed on costar Ping Medina.
    “If you had asked me about my plan, this could have been avoided. You are our captain on the set,” Geisler pointed out. “You can check the behind-the-scene (photos and videos) for proof of whether I was disrespectful toward anyone. There is none.”
    Arlyn dela Cruz
    He then accused Dela Cruz of “trying to pull off a Brillante Mendoza,” whenever she would allegedly instruct her actors to surprise their costars with a slap or two, so she could get a more natural reaction from them. “I was slapped many times, so I thought it was OK to surprise my co-actors,” he explained.
    Dela Cruz declared: “Ping Medina does not deserve what you did. No actor deserves that. No person deserves that… Define to me respect after what you did.”
    Geisler’s girlfriend, Niña Peña, told the Inquirer that the actor has already sent Medina a sorry note via text, but has not received any reply. (See Medina’s side on F2.)
    As for his last words for Dela Cruz, Geisler said: “So low of you to discredit my name. You are better than that. Mahal kita.”
    Meanwhile, Dela Cruz said she has “killed” Geisler’s character in the film. “The story and script will stand without you,” she added. “You told Ping you are ready to face the consequences of your action. Be ready to face it. Because you cannot get away with everything that you do, all the time.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Peña, who claimed to have stepped out to buy coffee when the incident happened, said Geisler meant no disrespect. “He thought that everyone would just laugh about it after filming the scene. Baron said he won’t feel offended if it was the other way around, because he is an artist.”
    Peña also said she believed that all will be well soon because Geisler and Medina are good friends.

    Paolo Ballesteros in “Die Beautiful”
    After bringing home the best actor (for Paolo Ballesteros) and Audience Choice trophies from the Tokyo fest last month, Jun Robles Lana’s “Die Beautiful” was chosen for a “surprise screening” at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada on Nov. 20.
    The Filipino film was shown in the Toronto fest’s Reel Talk section, alongside Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore’s much-awaited documentary “TrumpLand.”
    Needless to say, Toronto had been eagerly anticipating Lana’s latest film. Producer Perci Intalan recalled that organizers had contacted him and Lana only a week before the screening.

    Cameron Bailey, artistic director of the fest, explained that Toronto had screened Lana’s 2012 film, “Bwakaw.” We’re always interested in seeing his new work,” Bailey remarked.
    “When we heard that it had won two awards in Tokyo, I tracked it down for our Reel Talk audience.”
    Bailey reported that the screening went well.
    “The Toronto audience loved ‘Die Beautiful,’” Bailey related. “They were moved by Paolo’s performance and found that the film illuminated the transgender experience for them.”
    Lana’s film tells the story of a transgender beauty queen whose dying wish is to be made up as various glamorous celebrities, both local and foreign, during her weeklong wake.
    Bailey summed up the Filipino film as “moving, inspiring.”
    Lana is thrilled about the Toronto screening. “It’s an encouraging sign that our movie resonates and strikes a chord with audiences regardless of nationality.”

    Next stop for “Die Beautiful” is the 21st International Film Festival of Kerala, in India, from Dec. 9 to 16. Last year, Lana won best director in Kerala for “Anino sa Likod ng Buwan.”
    “Die Beautiful” is also one of the eight entries in this December’s Metro Manila Film Festival.
    Said Lana: “I am, more than ever, looking forward to sharing ‘Die Beautiful’ with our audiences here, and I hope it will get the same warm reception it has received in Tokyo and Toronto!”

    Lav Diaz’s “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis” was screened in the Festa Mobile section of the 34th Torino Film Festival, held in Turin, Italy, from Nov. 18 to 26.
    Critic Roberta Girau describes Diaz as “a giant auteur” and “Hele,” which focuses on the Philippine revolution of 1896, as “a great, great film.”
    “Hele” won the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the Berlinale this year.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The Torino fest’s website calls “Hele” a “metalinguistic account that combines historical research, literature, folklore and the collective unconscious.”

    Girau commends Diaz’s “extraordinary ability to travel [through time] with immeasurable grace…making [the viewers] vibrate and resonate in perfect harmony with the film’s images, characters…with nature, music, songs, poems.”
    He has succeeded in “creating a more abstract film compared to his previous works.” In this eight-hour epic, Diaz tackles “the eternal conflict between good and evil, constantly reiterating that evil is an integral part of life.”
    Still, Diaz celebrates man’s humanity in the face of chaos and darkness. Says Girau, “Diaz communicates [this] with a highly emotional film that speaks of a beautiful man and his soul…”
    Also this month, “Hele” was shown at the 3rd Brisbane Asia Pacific Film Festival in Australia, and at the 47th International Film Festival of Goa in India.
    Meanwhile, “Hele” will have screenings in four Philippine cities today (Nov. 30)—to commemorate the 153rd birth anniversary of revolutionary hero and Katipunan founder Andres Bonifacio.
    One of the historical threads that “Hele” weaves is widow Gregoria de Jesus’ “forlorn” search for the grave of her murdered husband, Bonifacio.
    “Hele” will be shown at the Cinematheque Center of the Film Development Council of the Philippines in Manila, Baguio, Iloilo and Davao.

    Diaz told the Inquirer that there will be Q&amp;As in the different venues.
    In Baguio, actor Ronnie Lazaro will present the film; in Davao, actor Bernardo Bernardo; in Iloilo, actress Sheenly Gener. Other cast and crew members will attend the screening in Manila, as well.
    Diaz, who is currently in Harvard for a Radcliffe Fellowship, asserted that the Cinematheque screenings are “for the Katipunan, for the Philippine Revolution, for the country.”

    “Pamilya Ordinaryo” is on a roll.
    Since winning the top prize at the Cinemalaya film fest last August, Eduardo Roy Jr.’s gritty urban drama has been snapping up awards all over the world—from Venice to Hanoi, from London to Brisbane.
    The latest honor of Roy’s film is the Student Jury Prize at the 17th Tokyo FILMeX, held in Japan over the weekend. Roy, who attended the fest with his “Pamilya” team, told the Inquirer: “We’re overjoyed. This award is special because it was given by students. And we were told it was a unanimous decision. No other film came close to us, a jury member informed us.”

    Eduardo Roy Jr.’s “Pamilya Ordinaryo” brought home two awards from the recently concluded 4th Hanoi International Film Festival held in Vietnam.
    Roy won best director and lead star Hasmine Killip clinched the best actress honor.
    Roy told the Inquirer that the victory is “overwhelming.” “I can’t believe it, because I was in the same competition as Thailand’s Apichatpong Weerasethakul (“Cemetery of Splendour”), who is one of my idols.”

Roy had to cancel a trip to the United States, where he was set to attend a screening of “Pamilya Ordinaryo” at the San Diego Asian Film Festival.

    The Philippines scored a triple whammy at the 29th Tokyo International Film Festival held at the Toho Cinemas Roppongi Hills on Thursday.
    Jun Robles Lana’s “Die Beautiful” brought home two trophies, Best Actor for lead star Paolo Ballesteros and the Audience Choice Award. Meanwhile, Mikhail Red’s “Birdshot” won the top prize in the Asian Future section.
    Lana praised Ballesteros’ performance as “stunning and heartfelt.”

    Red’s film “Birdshot” emerged as the best film in the section that seeks to celebrate the works of promising filmmakers. The young director previously competed in the same section for his feature film debut “Rekorder” in 2013.
    Red expressed gratitude for the rare honor, which he dedicated to the country, for being “a constant source of stories that filmmakers get to impart with the rest of the world.”
    He also shared the honor with his fellow” young filmmakers who are likewise struggling to let their voices be heard.” JE

    Brillante Ma. Mendoza, 2009 Cannes best director for “Kinatay” and the man responsible for Jaclyn Jose’s 2016 Cannes best actress win for “Ma’ Rosa,” explains how he responds to criticism that he indulges in poverty porn. “I don’t respond to them. As long as you know why you are making films, you have nothing to worry about. What’s important is that you make films because you want change, because you care for your country.” Will he ever make films about the wealthy? “I am not rich. I don’t know them. I am not familiar with their stories.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    “It’s a natural progression of this festival,” said 2016 Cinema One Originals festival director Ronald Arguelles of why this year’s edition of the annual indie fete would also feature three documentaries.
    For the first time, Cinema One gave a P1.5-million grant each to: Teng Mangansakan, whose “Forbidden Memory” lifts the veil on the event of September 1974 as it talks to the survivors of a gruesome mass murder that has been kept under wraps for decades; Paolo Picones and Gym Lumbera, whose “Piding” traces the history of a grieving ornithologist who returns to his hometown; John Torres, whose dreamlike and mysterious “People Power Bombshell” unearths a lost film by the late Celso Ad Castillo, and probes its circumstances and implications.
    Good addition
    “We have long planned for this. These docus fit the programming of Cinema One because they aren’t hardcore news. Aside from the narratives and shorts, or the foreign films, that will be showcased in this festival, they will be a good addition to the festival lineup or the content of the channel,” Arguelles, who’s also the channel head of Cinema One, told Inquirer on Wednesday.

    Also new this year is the forum that will focus on documentary and horror filmmaking in the Philippines. Arguelles said award-winning director Erik Matti is one of the speakers.
    Seven narrative features were also each given a grant of P3 million. Keith Deligero’s first foray into horror and myth is “Lily,” an urban legend in Cebu who is said to be a witch hunting for prey when the moon is full and shining brightly at night.
    The film features Cebuana actress Shaina Magdayao in the title role.

    Aside from her first international acting award, Lotlot de Leon also brought home a movie offer from Bollywood.
    Lotlot’s movie, Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem,” won best picture in the section for debuting directors at the All Lights India International Film Festival, held last month in Hyderabad, India. As bonus, Lotlot herself scored a special acting citation.
    The jurors simply adored the CineFilipino film, Lotlot recalled. “I saw and felt that the jury was united in loving our film. Even jurors from the other categories commended us and those who didn’t get to attend the screening kept asking for copies of the film.”

    “He was fascinated by Lotlot’s performance,” related Allan. “He Googled Lotlot’s filmography. He said he would be honored to collaborate with her in his next film.”
    After the red-carpet event, Lotlot confessed that she wanted to do cartwheels out of sheer happiness.
    “God is great, indeed! At the awards ceremony, I was just praying that God would bless my directors with an award in their section,” Lotlot told the Inquirer. “They truly deserved it—not only because of all the hardships they had gone through, but because they really made a beautiful film.”
    When her name was announced as recipient of a special acting honor, Lotlot was stunned speechless. “I was surprised because there were no acting categories in the festival and I was the only one who was given an award from all the entries.”
    Dexter recounted: “The jurors explained that it was for her exceptional portrayal. They just couldn’t allow her performance to go unnoticed. Ms Lotlot was on the verge of tears onstage.”

    Dexter was just as emotional upon winning the top prize in the debuting directors’ category. “My hands were shaking as I received the trophy.”
    Allan related that a number of viewers approached them after the premiere. “The students admitted that they were able to relate with the lead character. They asked for snapshots with Ms Lotlot and her costar Darwin Yu, who played her son in the movie.”

    “1st Sem” tells the story of an overprotective mom who can’t let go of her son, who’s leaving home for college.
    Allan said that “the mothers in the audience cried and sought out Lotlot after the screening.”
    “It’s inspiring to see the foreign audience’s reaction while watching our film,” Dexter explained. “Some laughed; others cried. After the screening, they approached us. They talked with Lotlot for a long time. An Indian actress even asked for a photo with her and Darwin.”
    “India is such a blessing for all of us,” Lotlot quipped. “It’s truly a memorable experience. Medyo delayed reaction lang ako. It’s only sinking in now. I think I’m going to have a nervous breakdown!”

    Bradley Liew’s “Singing in Graveyards,” which features rock icon Pepe Smith in the lead role, is going places—specifically, to Italy, South Korea, Greece and Brazil. First stop for the Malaysian-Philippine production was the Napoli Film Festival, which recently wrapped up in Italy.
    Producer Bianca Balbuena told the Inquirer: “Napoli’s programmer watched the film at the Venice fest. After the premiere, she immediately approached us, to ask if she could show the film in Napoli. She said it was masterfully crafted.”

    Running 11 minutes, “Maria” was produced by Tuko Film Productions and Buchi Boy Entertainment. It tells the stories of a 14-year-old girl who’s suspected of being pregnant by her family and a 50-year-old woman who gives birth to her 22nd child.
    Meanwhile, “Sandra,” which runs 15 minutes, follows “quirky” girls who join a pseudosorority only to escape from its twisted world after.

    The fest’s website remarks that the films in the program are some of “the best and freest from around the world.” These films “explore the boundaries of video art.”
    Organizers insist Kansk is “not a conventional film festival. It is an experiment in time and space.”  The top prize in the fest is called the “Golden Palm Pruner.”  BAYANI SAN DIEGO JR.

    “SUNDAY Beauty Queen”
    TWO DOCUMENTARIES, telling distinctly Filipino stories, are competing at the Busan International Film Festival, one of Asia’s most celebrated cinema events, set in South Korea tomorrow until Oct. 15.
    Baby Ruth Villarama’s “Sunday Beauty Queen” and Sheron Dayoc’s “The Crescent Rising” couldn’t be more different, but the two docus are united by a common goal to tell the Filipino story to the world.
    Interestingly, both films highlight the undeniable strength and resilience of Filipino women in divergent settings: the frenetic urban jungle of Hong Kong and the grief-stricken refugee camps of rural Mindanao.

    “Busan gives us a stage, where we can talk about Philippine docus and our crazy four-year adventure,” Villarama told the Inquirer.

    Yes, it took four years to finish her docu about Filipino domestic helpers who stage a beauty pageant in Hong Kong every year to commemorate Philippine Independence Day.
    “I am happy that there are two Filipino docus competing in Busan this year,” Villarama enthused. “It proves that Philippine documentary filmmaking is alive and well.”
    Dayoc agreed: “Busan gives us a bigger platform to share a crucial message: That it is vital for the Philippine government to address Mindanao’s problems. Beyond the politics, real lives are greatly affected by the silence and hopelessness.”
    Dayoc’s docu follows three Muslim widows who remain undeterred in their struggle to protect their war-ravaged community.
    Villarama’s docu similarly depicts the lives of three women living on the margins. “In Hong Kong, 190,000 Filipinos work as documented domestic helpers. Another 100,000 are undocumented and vulnerable to abusive employers.”
    Through her film, she hopes to initiate a dialogue on “diplomatic policies that would protect the rights of Filipino workers abroad.”
    Critics may regard the domestic helpers’ beauty contests as fluffy, regressive and antifeminist. Villarama, however, sees a joyous subversion in the revelry.

    At the onset, she wanted to tackle the “price of beauty and the fleeting happiness pageants provide in the face of the domestic helpers’ problems.”
    As the shoot progressed, however, Villarama realized that “justifying or criticizing” pageants was not the issue. “In the end, the docu should be about understanding the motivation behind it.”
    Simply put, the pageants are about “fighting to survive by simply striving to be happy,” she pointed out.
    “Like in fairy tales, they want their own version of ‘happily ever after,’ even for just a day, even if it would cost them some bittersweet endings,” she said.
    “THE CRESCENT Rising”
    On the other hand, Dayoc’s docu is very personal, stemming from his childhood.
    Dayoc, who hails from Zamboanga, recalled: “As a kid, my father, a military officer, was assigned to various conflict-affected areas in the country. His stories on the rebellion led me to regard Muslims as distant and different. As I matured, I nurtured a desire to understand the other side of the equation. Who are they? Beyond the war, what do their fathers, mothers and children dream of?”
    His docu is his modest attempt to comprehend the issues that have divided Mindanao for generations.
    “My film may not hold all the answers, but hopefully it will raise people’s consciousness,” he related. “As a Mindanaoan, I was given the opportunity to change people’s perspectives through cinema. We may not be able to alter the past, but we can always try to shape the future.”
    Documentaries hold that power, Villarama concurred.
    “Documentaries are like the family album of a nation,” she asserted. “Without them, there is no way for us to look at what we were in the past, what we are in the present and what we will be in the future. There are a hundred ways to make docus, other than what is aired on television. It is time to upgrade.”
    Dayoc volunteered: “In the Philippines, documentaries are perceived to be a lesser medium compared to fiction films. But both formats are equally important tools in telling the Filipino story.”

    Adolfo Alix Jr.’s “Mrs.” is in the lineup of the Vancouver International Film Festival in Canada, ongoing until Oct. 14. The best picture winner at this year’s Sinag Maynila fest, “Mrs.” is included in the Gateway/Dragons &amp; Tigers section.
    “Mrs.” features Lotlot de Leon, Rosanna Roces, Angeli Bayani, Anita Linda, Daria Ramirez, Sebastian Castro and Elizabeth Oropesa, as the film’s titular heroine, “a widow whose mind is usually elsewhere.”
    According to the Vancouver fest website, the Gateway section allows viewers to “journey into the compelling cinematic worlds envisioned by some of East Asia’s most adventurous artists.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Alix told the Inquirer that critic Tony Rayns programmed “Mrs.” in the festival.

    Rayns notes in the fest’s site that screen veteran Oropesa, who won best actress at Sinag Maynila, has bagged her “best latter-day role” in the indie drama.
    Oropesa plays a graying woman who is haunted by memories of her missing activist son (Castro), believed to be abducted by powerful men. She must also contend with the frequent pestering of a needy sister (Ramirez) and an equally troubled maid (De Leon)—along with the threat of an earthquake, because her decrepit home stands on a fault line.
    Rayns pointed out, “There are distant echoes of ‘Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?’” in the “powerful drama—especially in the central relationship” between the widow and her pregnant helper.
    The critic related that “Alix is unusual among Filipino directors of his generation, much less committed to low-life melodramas than most and able to tailor his visual style to the specific needs of his subjects and scripts.”
    In “Mrs.,” Rayns pointed out, Alix “opts for a slightly heightened realism with understated elements of fantasy. It’s not a horror movie, but there will be blood.”
    The Vancouver fest, which aims to “celebrate excellence in screen-based storytelling,” is one of the “top five cinema events in North America, in terms of admissions and number of films screened.”
    This year, the fest will showcase films from more than 70 countries on nine screens, including “the pick of the world’s top film fests and many undiscovered gems.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    The Vancouver fest is unique because it “features one of the largest selections of East Asian films outside of that region, along with Canadian movies and a vibrant documentary program.”
    “Mrs.” will be screened on Oct. 9 and 12 in Vancouver.

    ANDREI Fajarito
    Phil Giordano’s short film, “Supot,” won the grand jury prize at the 2016 New York Screenplay Contest, “a global [tilt] designed to launch careers and provide recognition and network opportunities to the world’s best new voices in writing for film and television.”
    According to its website, the competition’s “goal is to identify and award the very best screenwriters from around the world.”
    Based on Giordano’s thesis script at the New York University-Tisch Asia, “Supot” tells the story of a 10-year-old boy who’s reluctant to undergo circumcision—a rite of passage among Filipino men.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “Supot” also merited a good review from UK Film Review. The website’s critic Andrew Young lauds “Giordano’s measured approach and lack of moral judgment [which] really leaves its mark.”

    Young likewise commends Giordano’s “Hitchcockian” technique in the circumcision scenes, “using sound and reaction rather than full-on gore to make the audience wince.”
    Young points out that the short film “lets the audience do the work and is perhaps all the better for it… beyond its deceptively simple narrative, [it] has a lot to say. Heavy stuff, but expertly handled.”
    “Supot,” which features John Arcilla, Mercedes Cabral and Andrei Fajarito in the cast, will compete in the short film section of the Busan International Film Festival, to be held in South Korea from Oct. 6 to 15. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Meanwhile, Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem” won best feature film in the section for debuting directors. “1st Sem” lead actress Lotlot de Leon brought home a special acting citation, as well.
    De Leon’s prize is “the only award given to an actor in the entire festival,”  Hemedez told the Inquirer. “We can’t believe that we won. It was inspiring, watching our film with foreign viewers, who gave us positive feedback after the screening,” the young filmmaker said. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    After Venice and Toronto, “The Woman Who Left” goes to London. Fresh from its Golden Lion triumph at the Venice fest, Lav Diaz’s “Ang Babaeng Humayo” was added to the lineup of the 60th BFI (British Film Institute) London Film Festival in the United Kingdom from Oct. 5 to 16.
    The fest’s website describes the “slow-burn melodrama” as the “deserved winner of Venice’s Golden Lion.” On the website, critic Kate Taylor hails it as “a luminous film [that] explores the emotional burden borne by disenfranchised Filipinos who live in the shadow of colonialism.” “Humayo” will be shown on Oct. 15 and 16.
    The only other Filipino film in the BFI program, Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa,” will be screened on Oct. 6 and 9. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    RUBY Ruiz in “Imago”
    Raymund Ribay Gutierrez’s “Imago” won the Short Cuts Award for best short film at the recent 41st Toronto International Film Festival. The jury explained: “Some films are not easy to watch. But it’s a beautiful thing to find a filmmaker who has a daring voice.”
    The jurors praised the Filipino film as “a bold, cinematic statement,” adding that they “cannot wait to see what features this director will give to the world.”
    The jury members in the short films competition include filmmakers Abteen Bagheri (United States), Eva Husson (France) and Jeff Barnaby (Canada). The honor comes with a $10,000 cash prize.

    Apart from Mendoza, also part of the Masters program are Wim Wenders, Pedro Almodovar, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Hong Sang-soo, Olivier Assayas, among others.
    Meanwhile, the Wavelengths section presents “daring, visionary and autonomous voices.”
    The Wavelengths selection, the fest’s website points out, “challenges the mainstream and seeks to replenish and redefine the art of cinema,” adding that this year’s list boasts “an exciting mix of master and award-winning filmmakers, leading contemporary artists and emerging new talent.”
    The Short Cuts section, for its part, showcases “curated gems from Canada and the rest of the world.”
    The site describes “Ang Babaeng Humayo” as an examination of the “economic disparity in modern Filipino society, as seen through the eyes of a woman (played by Charo Santos-Concio) who’s released from prison 30 years after being framed and wrongfully convicted.”
    “Ma’ Rosa,” on the other hand, allows “Filipino firebrand” Mendoza to “incisively explore street-level corruption in Duterte-era Philippines with a tragicomic tale of a low-level drug dealer,” portrayed by Jaclyn Jose who won best actress at Cannes.
    Lastly, “Imago” follows a middle-aged single mother (Ruby Ruiz) who works as a funeral agent, a job “rife with risk and desperation.”

    SHARON Cuneta
    After  Nora Aunor, Judy Ann Santos and Vilma Santos, it’s Megastar Sharon Cuneta’s turn to act in a Cinemalaya film. Mega told the Inquirer that she will star and coproduce acclaimed indie filmmaker Mes de Guzman’s Cinemalaya entry for 2017, “Ang Pamilyang Hindi Lumuluha.”
    “We’ve been working on this project for more than a year now,” Mega related. “We are just looking for shoot dates. It will be my first indie film, if ever, and it has some fantasy elements.”
    The film tells the story of a desperate woman who turns to the mysterious “family who sheds no tears” in order to be reunited with her estranged husband and children.

    CHANEL Latorre and Ping Medina in “Maratabat”
    ARLYN dela Cruz’s debut film, “Maratabat (Pride and Honor),” won the Award of Merit at The Indie Fest, based in California, United States. Rick Prickett, competition director, told Dela Cruz that the jurors based their choices on “the quality, creativity and technical aspects of each film.”
    “Maratabat” earlier won best international film at the People’s Film Festival in New York last June.
    Dela Cruz told the Inquirer that the good news came while she was editing her fourth feature film, “Pusit.” “I’m proud of [the members of] the entire team who gave their all to my first film. It’s a victory that I share with everyone, most especially the actors who trusted a newcomer like me.”

    AS JANE the homeless teenaged mom in “Pamilya Ordinaryo”
    Like Nathan Lopez (“Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros”) and Mimi Juareza (“Quick Change”) before her, Hasmine Killip became the breakthrough star of the indie scene this season, with a stunning debut performance in Eduardo Roy Jr.’s “Pamilya Ordinaryo,” an entry in this year’s Cinemalaya and Venice Days fest.
    Hasmine, who is now based in London with her husband, British businessman Anthony Killip, was herself surprised by the glowing reviews she had received for her first full-length film.
    The daughter of a taxi driver and a housewife, Hasmine Formalejo-Killip never considered herself an actress before “accidentally” bagging the lead role in Carlo Francisco Manatad’s short film, “Junilyn Has.”

    In an e-mail interview, she told the Inquirer that she had zero acting experience prior to “Junilyn Has,” where she plays a bar girl forced to learn new dance moves in time for the Pope’s visit.

    She disclosed that she had no plans of trying out for the internationally acclaimed short film. “I just accompanied my best friend to the audition. But when Direk Carlo saw me, he asked me to also try my luck,” she said in Filipino.
    That unexpected stint led to a bigger opportunity.
    Based on her performance in “Junilyn Has,” the “Ordinaryo” team sought out the 21-year-old newbie and convinced her to audition for a role in the Cinemalaya film. (It helped that Carlo also served as editor of “Pamilya Ordinaryo.”)
    “At 11 p.m., I got a call from [line producer] Sarah Pagcaliwagan-Brakansiek. They gave me transportation fare to and from the audition,” she recalled. “I was nervous, but found the experience exciting, too.”
    After landing the role, “Direk allowed me and my lola to stay in his home. He would even cook for us. He is so kind! He didn’t allow me to spend a single centavo during my time with him.”
    “She lived in the suburbs, far from our location,” the director recounted.
    He also made sure Hasmine was well-prepared, by enrolling her in an acting workshop, under theater, TV and film veteran Ruby Ruiz. “That’s why I didn’t have a hard time on the set. I just recalled the lessons from the workshop,” she pointed out.

    HASMINE now trains as a care and support assistant in the United Kingdom. Facebook
    She enjoyed filming on the streets of Manila. “I loved every minute of it…that people were watching me. I wanted to do well, to impress the bystanders.”
    She also found a reliable partner in costar Ronwaldo Martin, Coco Martin’s brother. “I would ask permission beforehand whenever I needed to slap or hurt him. He always allowed me to do whatever I needed to do, to make the scene realistic.”
    During the shoot, she was applying for a UK visa at the same time.
    So, while her character was searching for a missing baby, she explained, she was also pining for “the love of my life,” who was oceans away. (She and Anthony tied the knot in October last year.)
    “I wanted to be with my husband. He was my inspiration during the making of the film,” she admitted.
    Although Hasmine is now based abroad, she still hopes to make more indie movies. (She is currently training as a care and support assistant.)
    She and her hubby plan to watch her full-length debut film at the Venice Days fest, which will be held in Italy from Aug. 31 to Sept. 10. “I’m happy that our film is going places,” she quipped. “I never imagined I would receive all these blessings.”
    But before anticipating how foreigners would receive the film in Venice, Hasmine would rather express her gratitude first for the positive feedback from the Cinemalaya audience.
    It’s quite fulfilling, she asserted. “It feels great that fellow Filipinos liked the film. It offered valuable lessons and opened people’s eyes to the harsh realities of life.”

    John Paul Su’s full-length feature debut, “Toto,” won the Audience Choice Award for Best Film at the 39th Asian American International Film Festival (AAIFF) in New York City from July 21 to 30. The director said he’s “grateful for and thrilled by” the reception his film had received in New York, where his “journey as a filmmaker began 11 years ago.”
    It was a homecoming of sorts for Su, who is a product of New York University. “Toto,” he related, was shown in the same theater, Village East Cinema, where his first US-produced short film, “Happy Anniversary,” was likewise screened in 2005.
    Presented by Asian Cinevision, the AAIFF is “the first and longest running festival devoted to films by and about Asian-Americans.”

    Lav Diaz’s short film, “Ang Araw Bago ang Wakas,” won best feature at the recent 14th Tabor Film Festival in Zabok, Croatia. Diaz’s film, which runs for 17 minutes, offers “a dark vision of the future,” said a report in a Croatian website.
    The same film earlier won the Principal Prize at the recent 62nd International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in Germany. Diaz’s short film takes place on the eve of a typhoon and features various ordinary Filipinos reciting Shakespearean lines.
    “It’s all for Philippine cinema,” Diaz said of his latest honor.

    Three Filipino films will be shown at the 65th Melbourne International Film Festival, to be held in Australia from July 28 to Aug. 14. Two short films, Raymond Gutierrez’s “Imago” and Rina B. Tsou’s “Arnie,” are part of the Southeast Asian Shorts program, while Lav Diaz’ “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis” is included in the Accent on Asia section.
    The Southeast Asian Shorts  program showcases “great talent and potential from a new generation of filmmakers who are attempting to capture the idiosyncrasies of their countries, as well as the universal narratives that take place within them.”
    An entry in the Shorts tilt of this year’s Cannes, Gutierrez’ “Imago,” according to the fest’s site, “dives head first into somber territory … Blunt in its depiction of the unusual line of work [of a funeral agent], [it] subtly brings morality into the question and reflects on what people do for survival.”

    Filipino-Taiwanese Tsou’s “Arnie” tells the story of a Pinoy seaman in Kaohsiung. Tsou’s film, the fest website’s reports, “features recurring shots of fish-out-of-water and on the cutting block, forming a pertinent metaphor on the state of foreign workers who are separated from their homeland in order to provide … for their loved ones.”

    Diaz’ eight-hour Berlin winner is hailed by the fest’s website as “truly epic in scope.” “Drawing heavily from history, literature and mythology… [‘Hele’] delves deep into the contours of Filipino identity, past and present.”
    Founded in 1952, the Melbourne fest presents “the best in current cinema from around the world.” The annual event is “one of the oldest film festivals in the world and the most significant cinema gathering in Australia.”

    KHAVN dela Cruz in “Alipato”
    Filipino filmmaker Khavn dela Cruz joins the jury of the main tilt of the 20th Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (Bifan), in South Korea from July 21 to 31. Dela Cruz told the Inquirer that among his fellow jurors in the Bucheon Choice Features competition are Cannes deputy Christian Jeune, producer Garrick Dion (“Whiplash,” “Drive”) and actress Jang Mi-hie (“Winter Woman,” “The Deaf Worker”).
    Bucheon Choice aims to “present original films from all over the world … and discover titles with new points of view that subvert values that are taken for granted … and challenges conventional genre grammar in commercial films.”
    The fest’s competition section highlights the “innovative, experimental spirit … [a] unique vision and style.”

    The fest’s website related that Dela Cruz’s “films are known for their darkly humorous portrayals of outsiders in the underbelly of urban life.” His latest film, “Alipato: The Very Brief Life of an Ember,” which features Dido dela Paz and Marti San Juan in the cast, will have its Asian premiere in the Bifan’s World Fantastic Red section.

    LOS ANGELES—The title is “Come Swim,” and she’s ready to shoot it in three weeks. Kristen Stewart disclosed details of her narrative directing debut in our chat at the Crosby Street Hotel in SoHo, New York.
    Without fanfare, Kristen quietly walked into the room, looking sharp in a black Rag &amp; Bone jacket with rolled up sleeves, white shirt, gray pants and black patent leather flats.
    The would-be director sheepishly explained the “X” stamped on her right wrist. “Oh, I didn’t have my ID last night,” she said. “I went to play pool, and they were like, ‘You cannot drink.’ I was like, ‘Fine, that’s fine.’  So, he (bouncer) put an X on my hand.”

    Kristen recounted how “Come Swim” began. It will be her short film directing debut. In 2014, she codirected with David Ethan Shapiro a music video of the band, Sage + The Saints, for their song, “Take Me to the South.”

    “I usually work in spurts,” she began. “I did five movies in a year and a half. I wrote a short story, like a poem that I’ve developed three years ago. I’m shooting it in three weeks. I’m so excited about it. We’re ready to go.”
    Beaming, Kristen added: “I’ll probably act in a movie after that, but this (directing) is where I want to be. I’ve wanted to make movies since I was 9 years old. I don’t think there’s a huge divide between acting and directing.”
    She shared what another actress-turned-director told her: “Jodie Foster said, when I told her I was going to make this movie, ‘The first thing you’re going to learn is that you don’t have much to learn—and that you’re totally ready.’ For her to say that, it feels good.”
    Asked who is starring in “Come Swim,” Kristen replied, “My friend, Josh. He’s not an actor, but he’s incredible.” We did not get to ask Josh’s last name.
    As for her film’s budget, Kristen grinned and quipped, “I’m not telling you.” “Come Swim” is part of an anthology of short films commissioned by Refinery29, a fashion and lifestyle website.
    Kristen and 11 other female filmmakers, including “Empire’s” Gabourey Sidibe and Chloe Sevigny, were invited by Refinery29 to make films under its ShatterBox Anthology.
    Kristen admitted that making “Come Swim” is one of the creative perks of fame. “I get to make a short film, and I’m not even paying for it,” she pointed out.

    Our budding auteur is learning from some of the best filmmakers she’s had the privilege to work with: Woody Allen (“Café Society”), Ang Lee (“Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk”) and Olivier Assayas (“Personal Shopper” and “Clouds of Sils Maria”), among others.
    For her performance in “Clouds,” Kristen became the first American actress to win a Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscars.
    We asked Kristen about being directed by Woody for the first time in “Café Society,” a comedy-drama set in the 1930s.
    Kristen’s Vonnie is caught in a love triangle story, written by Woody. The film also stars Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively and Steve Carell.
    “Like many of my favorite directors, but in his own unique way, he allows you to own your part,” the actress said of her legendary director. “I thought there was going to be more direction. It was like, once you said your line, in entirety or even not, you moved on. What that does for his movies is all of the poignant moments happen, then they hit you after the fact.”
    Woody, known for his unusually brief casting meetings—lasting for only a few minutes—with actors, was just as quick with Kristen. In fact, the iconic filmmaker did not even meet the actress in person. She just sent a video.
    “It was a phone call (with Woody) asking me to read a couple of scenes, and he thought I was good for the part,” Kristen recounted.
    Asked if she would pick the same guy if she were in the same love triangle in real life, Kristen answered, “I have no idea. I feel like I always have to justify the decisions that my characters make in order to play them. I like Jesse a lot.”
    Speaking of Jesse, when Kristen was reminded that they were also involved in a love triangle (with Ryan Reynolds, as the older guy, completing the troika) in “Adventureland,” she agreed: “Yeah, that’s true.  That’s weird.”
    Of Jesse, with whom she also worked in “American Ultra,” making “Café Society”—the third time they are paired, Kristen commented, “I love Jesse.  He’s  a wonderful person. His intelligence is not off-putting; it’s like something that you want to keep up with. So, he makes me feel good.  I feel confident around him. I could just be the stupidest person around him, and he still likes me.”
    Kristen recalled that being younger then, she and Jesse “had a lot more anxiety. I gave him cookies and stuff when he couldn’t eat, because he was nervous.
    “We’ve calmed down a bit, which is nice, but we’re still the same. We have the exact same dynamic. We don’t hang out in between. But as soon as we see each other, what we have very naturally comes immediately.”
    Kristen was also excited about “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” a drama that contrasts the realities of war with America’s perceptions, because of the pioneering technology that Ang used.
    According to The Hollywood Reporter, “Billy Lynn” is the first major motion picture release to have been shot at a high frame rate of 120 frames-per-second 3D at 4K resolution and in high dynamic range (HDR). Films are usually shot at 24 frames per second.
    The resulting movie is reportedly a fully immersive experience for moviegoers. “I can’t wait to see this movie because it’s been described to me as revolutionary, and has more information than our eyes have ever received in a given second,” Kristen pointed out.
    “Being so out of my element on a movie set was strange, because that’s where I live. I usually know what’s going on. Joe (Alwyn), who plays the title character, was asking me questions because it was his first movie. It was bizarre.”
    Also being eagerly awaited is “Personal Shopper,” for which Olivier won the best director award (he tied with Cristian Mungiu).
    On this ghost story set in Paris’ fashion underworld, Kristen remarked, “I feel like the scariest parts of the movie are not the supernatural aspects. But it’s the questions that you ask about the afterlife or what life is in relation to the afterlife. And whether or not we’re alone or whether we live in the Matrix, and we’re making all this up.”
    When Kristen was teased about how “competitive” she was when she and Jimmy Fallon played Twister, the classic contortion game but with Jell-O shots, in his show, she smiled and said, “It’s embarrassing. It’s just that I like playing games.” Well, she won.
    What game does she enjoy playing? “Oh man, I love pool,” she said with a smile. “I’m obsessed with it.”
    Looking back on those “Twilight” years, Kristen matter-of-factly talked about how the mania is dying down. She declared: “That fervor isn’t there anymore, which is nice.
    “I just ran into Catherine Hardwicke (who directed the first movie in the franchise) the other day, and that sent me back. It was lovely to see her. It made me feel good.”
    The “Twilight” topic brought to mind those years which kindled her relationship with her costar, Robert Pattinson. They split in 2013.
    In 2015, Kristen was quoted as saying in a published interview, “Google me, I’m not hiding. I think in three or four years, there are going to be a whole lot more people who don’t think it’s necessary to figure out if you’re gay or straight. It’s like, just do your thing.”
    In May, Kristen was reported to have broken up with French singer and musician, Stephanie “Soko” Sokolinski, after a few months of dating.
    Asked if her heart has been broken like her character Vonnie’s in “Café Society,” she exclaimed, “Oh my God, I’ve been destroyed!”
    So, how does she mend her broken heart? “Don’t ignore it.  If you’re in pain, just be like, owww! ”

    NORA Aunor in “Taklub”
    Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Taklub” won best film at the first MónFilmat Festival Internacional de Cinema I Paisatge, held recently in Amposta, Catalonia, Spain.  Mendoza told the Inquirer that he was “surprised but happy” about this latest honor.
    The fest’s jurors, which consisted of actors and critics, awarded the top prize to Mendoza’s film on Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) which shows the “fighting ability (resilience) of the Filipino people.” MónFilmat highlights films that feature the “landscape not just as part of the action, but also as an actor.”
    The fest aims to “reclaim cinema as a collective experience,” with outdoor screenings. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    MERYLL Soriano and John Lloyd Cruz in “Honor Thy Father”
    Erik Matti’s “Honor Thy Father” won best Asian film at the awarding ceremony of the 15th Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival in Switzerland on Saturday.
    The fest’s website hails the Filipino movie as “a very elegant thriller … a mesmerizing film noir that fiercely criticizes the place of religion” in Philippine society. It is Matti’s third time in the Swiss fest. He previously screened the superhero flick “Gagamboy” in 2005 and the creature feature “Tiktik” in 2013.
    The fest’s website relates that this annual event, which attracted more than 37,000 attendees last year, is distinguished by its “rich and diversified programming, constructed around one central axis: Fantastic cinema.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Nine full-length film entries in Cinemalaya announced
    
    
    Nine full-length films, which are products of the “new competition cycle,” will be showcased in the first “open competition” of this year’s Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, according to its organizers.
    The full-length entries are: “Ang Bagong Pamilya ni Ponching” by Inna Miren Salazar and Dos Ocampo; “Dagsin,” Atom Magadia; “Hiblang Abo,” Ralston Jover; “I America,” Ivan Andrew Payawal; “Kusina,” David Corpuz and Cenon Palomares; “Lando at Bugoy,” Vic Acedillo Jr.; “Mercury is Mine,” Jason Paul Laxamana; “Pamilya Ordinaryo,” Eduardo Roy Jr.; and “Tuos,” Derick Cabrido.
    An entry, “Maselang Bahaghari” by J. E. Tiglao, backed out due to lack of funding, said Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) artistic director Chris Millado.

    “To recall, we announced in 2015 the three major changes that will be implemented by the Cinemalaya Foundation and the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 2016 and thereafter,” Cinemalaya Foundation president Laurice Guillen said at a recent luncheon at the CCP in Pasay City.
    The first of three major changes is that the full-length feature category would have a two-year film production cycle. “The first six months is allotted for the film selection process and the remaining months, which is a little over a year, for movie production,” Guillen explained.
    LAURICE Guillen
    “Second, we would no longer distinguish a film as either for the New Breed or Directors’ Showcase categories,” she added. “Third, the seed grant was increased to P750,000 and hopefully more in the coming years.”
    “Last year, we focused on the shorts, giving their filmmakers an unprecedented audienceship and emphasis,” said Millado, adding that there would be 10 finalists again this year.
    The shorts are: “Ang Hapon ni Nanding” (Nanding’s Afternoons) by Rommel Tolentino; “Ang Maangas, Ang Marikit at Ang Makata,” Jose Ibarra Guballa; “Bugtaw,” Noah del Rosario; “Butas,” Richard Cawed; “Fish Out of Water,” Mon A.L. Garilao; “Forever Natin,” Cyrus Valdez; “Get Certified,” Isaias Herrera Zantua; “Mansyong Papel,” Ogos Aznar; “Nakauwi Na,” John Relano, Patrick Baleros and Luis Hidalgo; and “Pektus,” Isabel Quesada.
    “There will also be at least 60 exhibition films to be screened in the coming festival… They are the best reasons for being part of this year’s Cinemalaya,” said Millado.
    Other 2016 Cinemalaya features mentioned by Millado:  Cinemalaya has partnered with the Eigasai Japanese Film Festival, through the Japan Foundation. Two films, “Ken and Kazu” by Hiroshi Shoji and “August in Tokyo” by Ryutaro Nakagawa, will be screened for free.

    The audience can experience Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Turkey, China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and India in the comfort of their theater seats through the Asian Showcase section.
    The Cinemalaya also offers the following sections—Festival’s Best, Documentaries, and Cinemalaya Institute showcase.
    There will be a showcase of the “significant cinematic contributions” of the late director Francis Xavier Passion, who died in March this year. His films “Jay” (2008) “Sampaguita” (2010) and “Bwaya” (2014) will be exhibited.
    CHRIS Millado
    There will be a special screening section of Lav Diaz’s  eight-hour film “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis” and his 16-minute “Ang Araw Bago ang Wakas.”
    There will be a Green Carpet screening, which is “an innovation this year” and a mini concert.
    Filmmakers will get the chance to pitch their dream projects to producers during the Film Financing Forum, an event that the Cinemalaya organized in cooperation with the Directors’ Guild of the Philippines Inc.
    Film buffs can also schedule private screenings with friends at the new Samsung Screening Lounge.
    Cinemalaya will be bigger this year as it expands its reach beyond Metro Manila to Cebu City. Aside from screenings at the CCP and at satellite venues at Ayala Cinemas in Greenbelt 3 and Glorietta in Makati; Trinoma and UP Town Center in Quezon City; and Nuvali in Sta. Rosa, there will also be screenings at Ayala Mall in Cebu.

    “KAPATIRAN”
    PEPE Diokno’s “Kapatiran” scores a positive review from The Hollywood Reporter’s Clarence Tsui. In an essay published June 30, Tsui, who saw the Filipino film at the Karlovy Vary film fest (ongoing until July 9), describes it as “a harsh but heartening hymn set amidst the lives of both moneyed young gods and penniless plebeians.” The movie follows privileged law students undergoing initiation to join a fraternity.
    Tsui asserts that “Kapatiran” is not just a spine-tingling thriller,” it offers “a raucous twist on the filth-and-fury, realist aesthetics … of Lino Brocka and Brillante Ma. Mendoza.”
    The critic points out that “while eschewing the extreme grotesqueries … of Khavn dela Cruz’s ’Mondomanila,’ Diokno’s visions are equally scary.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Tsui insists that the film is “dizzying in its structure, but deadly when it lands that fatal hook.”

    ANNICKA Dolonius and Sid Lucero in “Apocalypse Child”
    Mario Cornejo’s “Apocalypse Child” has earned a rave review from Film School Rejects, an entertainment blog based in the United States. In his June 26 essay, the website’s chief film critic Rob Hunter summed up the Filipino surfing flick as “raw and affecting.”
    Hunter, who saw “Apocalypse Child” at the New York Asian Film Festival (ongoing until July 9), commended the screenplay (by Cornejo and Monster Jimenez), cinematography (by Ike Avellana), music (by Armi Millare) and the “strong” cast (led by Sid Lucero, Annicka Dolonius, RK Bagatsing, Gwen Zamora and Ana Abad Santos).
    Santos, who recently won best supporting actress at the Gawad Urian, was declared the “standout.” Dolonius was likewise praised for her “heart-wrenching performance.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Hunter wrote that the camera work possessed an effortless “sensuality…a sexy, alluring vibe… [that’s] tangible, seductive and…  impossible to resist.” The Filipino film, Hunter conceded, was undoubtedly aided by the “natural beauty” of its setting, the surfers’ mecca, Baler, Aurora.

    While the screenplay and direction were praised for being “low key,” the music was hailed for “speaking perfectly to the emotions…explored” in the story.
    The film centers on a surfing instructor who is believed to be the son of an Oscar winner who wandered into a sleepy town to shoot an acclaimed Hollywood movie.
    In sum, “Apocalypse Child” was described, thus: “A beautiful little film about people in distress in paradise.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Three Filipino films will be screened at the 51st Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, in the Czech Republic, from July 1 to 9. Apart from Lav Diaz’s “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis” and Pepe Diokno’s “Kapatiran,” Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa” is also in the lineup of Karlovy Vary—one of the A-list film festivals in the world.
    The fest’s web site called “Kapatiran” “fascinating and harrowing” and “Ma’ Rosa” a “rain-swept… small-scale drama.”
    Meanwhile, the site praised “Hele” as “one of the most distinctive and artistic films of the year… a historical, philosophical and social tour de force.”

    Ralston Jover’s “Hamog (Haze)” won the Outstanding Artistic Achievement Award at the 19th Shanghai International Film Festival held in China on Sunday. Jover attended the A-list festival with lead actress Therese Malvar.
    Jover told the Inquirer that he was “surprised” by the win. “It was the first award to be handed out that evening,” he recalled. “I was very happy, but it also felt weird because the Chinese audience members, after congratulating me, would ask to hold the trophy—as if they were awardees, too.”
    The jury, led by Serbian director Emir Kusturica, commended the Filipino film which tells the story of street children. Kusturica explained that “the documentary style fits the subject matter … authentic.”

    WILL Fredo
    WILL Fredo’s “Traslacion: Ang Paglalakad sa Altar ng Alanganin (The March to the Altar of Uncertainty)” won best documentary at the Soho International Film Festival last Thursday. The director, who attended the fest in New York, told the Inquirer that he’s overjoyed to receive an award for his first docu.
    “I didn’t know how people would accept it,” he admitted. “I made the docu for my own enlightenment, to understand my own prejudices.”
    The docu follows different LGBTQ couples—their lives and loves, and their struggles for equality.

    “The past week has been quite a journey for me,” the director pointed out. “When we arrived in the United States, the first news we heard was the mass murder in Orlando, Florida. It gave me goosebumps… our film is quite timely. I have learned so much from it.”

    SCENE from the award-winning film
    A film on Filipino domestic helpers won two citations at the Brooklyn Film Festival, held in New York from June 3 to 12. Patrick Daly and Joel Fendelman’s “Remittance” bagged Certifications of Outstanding Achievement for screenplay (Daly and Fendelman) and lead actress (Angel Barotia).
    According to the film’s website, “Remittance” is a “realistic portrayal of low-wage migrant workers in Singapore, shot in real locations with a cast that includes actual domestic workers.”
    Best actress Barotia is a real-life domestic helper working in Singapore. In the film’s website, Barotia related that she was originally a vegetable vendor from Albay and moved to Singapore in 2009.

    She admitted that she earns more abroad and regularly sends money to her husband and two daughters back home. Said Barotia: “I don’t want to get rich. I don’t need a big house. I just want to be happy. When I go home, I’ll set up a daycare center, because I love kids.”

    Barotia also acted in a play titled “Rojak” at Play Den @ The Arts House. She related that she felt strongly about joining the cast of “Remittance”: “This is my story, and I want to be part of telling it.”
    The filmmakers noted that “Remittance” tells “a global story about the commodification of labor…the exportation of mothers, from third world countries to first world nations.”
    In the film’s website, the filmmakers explained that they took an “anthropological approach” in making “Remittance.” “Our process involves spending time in various communities, developing relationships that allow for access to worlds not usually shown to outsiders. We are interested in telling the less obvious story and celebrating the drama of everyday life.”
    FILMMAKERS and Barotia on the set of “Remittance”
    Daly and Fendelman previously collaborated on the documentary, “Needle Through Brick” (2005), the short film, “Daud” (2009) and the feature film, “David” (2011). “Remittance” is their second feature film.

    “KAPATIRAN”
    Pepe Diokno’s “Kapatiran (Brotherhood)” will be screened at the 51st Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, in the Czech Republic, from July 1 to 9. The indie film, which premiered at the QCinema fest last year, is in Karlovy Vary’s Out of Competition section.
    The fest’s website remarks that Diokno’s “ambitious” film “contemplates the breakdown of Philippine society,” adding that it “erases the border between fiction and documentary.” The festival hails it as “a fascinating and harrowing portrait of a social order determined by tribal groupings.”
    Karlovy Vary is one of the oldest A-list festivals in the world, and is part of the esteemed list that also includes Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Locarno, San Sebastian, Shanghai, Moscow, Montreal, Warsaw, Tokyo, Tallinn, Cairo, Mar del Plata and Goa. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    BRILLANTE Ma. Mendoza has confirmed that his latest film, “Ma’ Rosa,” will open in cinemas nationwide on July 6. Instead of joining the Metro Manila Film Festival in December, the film’s local distributor, Solar Entertainment, has opted for an earlier playdate, while its lead star Jaclyn Jose’s best actress win in Cannes is still hot news, Solar president/CEO Wilson Tieng relates. The July opening also makes “Ma’ Rosa” eligible as a possible Philippine entry in the Oscar best foreign language film category, Tieng points out. “Ma’ Rosa” will open in November in France, where it is distributed by Pyramid, says Mendoza.

    “HAPPY New Year”
    Filipino filmmaker Joseph Israel Laban’s documentary, “Happy New Year,” won best film (Melhor Filme) at the III Festival de Finos Filmes in São Paulo, Brazil last May 10.
    The lone Philippine entry, Laban’s film competed with works from Germany, New Zealand, Greece, among others.
    This latest honor is “personally significant,” Laban told the Inquirer, “because it is my first film award for a docu.”

    The film takes place at the Tondo General Hospital on New Year’s Eve, a busy time for doctors and nurses who must attend to firecracker victims and women in labor.
    Laban explained: The film “offers an unfiltered look at birth and death, which naturally occupy the same unnatural space in one of Manila’s poorest and oldest districts.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    HAZEL Orencio in “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis”
    The latest issue of the publication Film Comment features a rave review of Lav Diaz’s eight-hour epic, “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis.”
    Written by critic Olaf Möller, the piece recalled the Filipino film’s triumphant screenings at this year’s Berlinale, where it won the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize.
    Recounted Möller: “Diaz visibly enjoyed the adoration he received—all deserved, for he had achieved something that seemed almost impossible. He had made it to an A-level festival … without compromising his ethics, morality or aesthetics—and with one of his greatest works so far, to boot.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Möller took note of “Hele’s” relevance in light of the spate of “historical” epics that have been churned out of late by both mainstream and indie filmmakers.

    “Hele,” he wrote, “is not a film about [Andres] Bonifacio, but it is at least the third film in four years that’s related to the historical significance and the personal biography” of the revolutionary hero.
    Möller pointed out: “There’s a war raging on Philippine screens over the depiction of the nation’s history and, therefore, its future. Most of these films have a political agenda, plus ties to parties and other powerful organizations.”
    Indeed, films like Mark Meily’s “El Presidente” and Enzo Williams’ “Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo” are not innocent, objective signifiers—but powder kegs of meaning that could either revisit or revise history, depending on the filmmakers’ ideologies. Back to Möller, he asserted that “Hele” “is greater than all that … [it’s] a complex, demanding allegory and philosophical treatise.”
    Möller described “Hele” as “a visually sumptuous modernist monument whose beauty is at times of an unexpectedly Eisensteinian inspiration.” He then added that the film “is a clarion call for change.”
    Such insights become all the more potent because the country is at the crossroads once again. Möller noted: “Diaz certainly made no secret … of his political hopes for ‘Hele’: to influence [the] elections.”
    Once again, Diaz’s timing proved impeccable.
    “Hele” will have screenings at the  Cinematheque Manila on May 20, 22, 27 and 29. All screenings of “Hele,” which runs for eight hours and five minutes, begin at 11 a.m., with two breaks: one hour-long and the other for 30 minutes.

    “OF CATS, Dogs, Farm Animals and Sashimi”
    Filipino  filmmaker Perry Dizon’s latest work, “Of Cats, Dogs, Farm Animals and Sashimi,” won special jury prize at the 10th Taiwan International Documentary Film Festival last May 12.
    The film centers on a Subanen boy who works in a rubber plantation in Zamboanga.
    It shows how a young man, “at a tender age, was exposed to the hardships of being the son of a seasonal worker.”

    “ANG ARAW Bago ang Wakas”
    After  winning the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the Berlinale for “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis,” Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz won in another German film fest.
    Diaz’s 16-minute work, “Ang Araw Bago ang Wakas,” won the Principal Prize at the 62nd International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, held last May 10.
    Diaz’s film competed with two other works, France’s “If It Was” by Laure Prouvost and Finland’s “Retrospective” by Salla Tykka.

    Diaz’s entry takes place on the eve of a storm and features ordinary Filipinos reciting Shakespearean lines. The jury hailed Diaz’s entry as “a work of political urgency…a short film [that] is both elaborate and succinct…Here, otherwise canonical text arrives as a…site of last resort.”

    Chuck Gutierrez’s “Iisa (As One)” will make its European premiere at the 27th Ankara International Film Festival in Turkey from April 28 to May 8. “It is the lone Filipino film in the lineup,” Gutierrez told the Inquirer. “Iisa” is part of the From the World of Festivals program.
    Theme of this year’s fest is “Sight and Sound.” According to the fest’s website: “Film’s function [is the] creation of meaning.”
    “Iisa,” which focuses on the devastation caused by Typhoon “Pablo” in Mindanao in 2012, premiered at the QCinema International Film Festival last year. Prior to Ankara, “Iisa” was shown at the Festival Cinematografico Internacional del Uruguay last March. It is also competing at the Cameroon International Film Festival, ongoing until April 30.

    <content>Sinag Maynila: Gino Santos vows to scare with ‘Lila’
    
    
    Young director Gino Santos has promised that his Sinag Maynila entry “Lila” will offer a unique experience.
    With GMA actress Janine Gutierrez playing the titular character, together with ABS-CBN heartthrob Enchong Dee, the psychological thriller is expected to scare moviegoers.

    “In the film, you have drama, you have [themes] about family… horror, suspense and psychological aspects,” Santos said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.

    “Lila” revolves around the story of Jess (Gutierrez), who moves into the house of her kind-hearted landlady (Sherry Lara). Finding a diary owned by an old tenant, she gets caught up in paranormal events as his cousin (Dee) tries to save her.
    “It is more of mixing [old and new] generation,” said Santos. “That is why you have the character of Lola Violeta, whose habits are typical of Filipino elders, and she needs Jess, who is very youthful, very techy. She teaches Jess how to do household chores. They develop a relationship and they become friends.”
    But the characters have underlying personal issues, as Santos related.
    “They are carrying [emotional] baggage. They all have secrets. They all have desires. It’s up to them how they deal with the issues inside their house,” he said.
    “They are all longing for something. Longing to have a child, longing to escape from a dark past,” he added.
    The 26-year-old Santos is the director of youth-oriented films “The Animals” (Cinemalaya 2012) and “#Y” (Cinemalaya 2014).
    “I have done horror short films before. I kind of graduated from the teen genre and I wanted to go back to my roots and explore myself as filmmaker,” he said.

    Santos  hopes that “Lila” will be appreciated by the festival supporters. “I as a filmmaker and my writer try to play with the emotions [of the audience]. [We] will try to get impact from [the audience] with the score and ‘gulat’ factor.”
    The Sinag Maynila Film Festival will run from April 21-26 at SM Megamall, SM Aura Premier, SM North Edsa, SM Mall Of Asia and SM Manila.

    Exciting, diverse and socially relevant.
    These are the words used by world-renowned director Brillante Mendoza to capsulize the lineup of films for the second edition of Sinag Maynila Film Festival this month.

    Out of 104 submissions, five full-length features were chosen to be showcased in cinemas through P2-million grants awarded to the respective filmmakers.
    BACKSTORY: Sinag Maynila Film Festival now poised for its second year
    These are “Mrs.” by Adolf Alix Jr., “Expressway” by Ato Bautista, “Dyamper” by Mes de Guzman, “T.P.O.” by Jay Altarejos and “Lila” by Gino Santos.
    “This year, we added the short film and Cinephone categories. It is exciting because the festival doesn’t only give grants but also supports the other aspects of filmmaking,” Mendoza told INQUIRER.net.
    The Sinag Maynila is the brainchild of Mendoza, the festival director, and Solar Entertainment CEO Wilson Tieng. Since its inauguration in March last year, it has helped independent directors to develop their fresh and unexplored material to a full-length film for public exhibition.
    Mendoza maintained that as much as possible they want to present quality Filipino movies with social relevance.
    “We don’t want to just show the usual genre films. That even genre films, like action or horror, could still be socially relevant only if the filmmakers are aware that we want to create critical thinkers from our audience,” he said.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    He also noted how the financial grant significantly encouraged filmmakers to take part in the festival.
    “These are the stories that you don’t usually see on mainstream because they are not really commercial in a way. The mere fact that we give them the chance to develop their films…it’s an important sign for different filmmakers that in the future they could also submit their films and make it into reality,” he said.
    Sinag Maynila’s first edition spawned masterpieces that have made rounds in 36 international film festivals, many of which reaped awards and recognitions.
    Among them are Zig Dulay’s “Bambanti”, Lawrence Fajardo’s “Imbisibol” and Remton Zuasola’s “Swap”.

    “We are expecting this year to be successful in terms of resonating with the audience and also, when we send them abroad, they would be much appreciated,” Tieng said.
    The ideological father of the new Philippine cinema Lav Diaz heads the board of jury for the second Sinag Maynila, together with four other international festival programmers.
    The festival will run from April 21 to 26 in selected SM Cinemas.

    <content>Sinag Maynila: Blood, bullets, gore collide in Ato Bautista’s ‘Expressway’
    
    
    “Entertaining” is how director Ato Bautista described his Sinag Maynila entry “Expressway.”
    “As you follow the two characters, you wouldn’t know where they will go or what will happen,” Baustista spoke of his main actors Aljur Abrenica and Alvin Anson.

    The action-thriller will take the indie viewers to the last assignment of a veteran gunman Ben, who is ready to be granted his retirement. Tagging along with him is a neophyte killer Morris (Abrenica), who is more than eager to impress his syndicate boss.

    The two criminals may be in the same boat, but their clashing demeanor is what makes their alliance colorful.
    “Alvin is serious, while Aljur is a joker…but he suddenly gets mad,” the director told INQUIRER.net. “But you get to empathize with them. You [will] love them and hate them.”
    He said the film explores the relationship of the master and his protégé in a journey of self-healing and redemption.
    The idea for “Expressway” was born ages ago and Bautista first had Rudy Fernandez in mind to play Anson’s part. “[But] my writer and I created it and wrote it for whoever after that may land on it.”
    The director nevertheless is very much satisfied with the performance of his chosen actors. “There are so many actors in the industry that we have yet to see their range and capabilities because they haven’t been given the opportunity to show it.”
    “Whenever I make independent films likes this and I get the liberty to choose the actors that I want to work with. I get the actors that I believe will offer their talents to the audience,” he said.
    “Expressway” also stars RK Bagatsing, Jim Libiran, Kiko Matos, Inez Bernardo, Japo Parcero and Arpee Bautista.

    What will it take for an abuser to stop being one?
    In Joselito Altarejos’ “T. P. O. (Temporary Protection Order)”, a cycle of domestic violence between an abusive husband Miguel (Oliver Aquino) and a battered wife Teresa (Mara Lopez) is explored.

    The film is one of the five full-length features in competition at the second Sinag Maynila Film Festival this month.

    Altarejos told INQUIRER.net a  gist of the storyline: After a night of beating, Teresa sought a temporary protection order against Miguel. The parents of Miguel, meanwhile, urged him to gain custody of his son JR (Micko Laurente).
    “It’s a very simple film,” the director said. “A tug-of-war of familial rights…who really is the victim in this kind of set-up?”
    He likened his treatment of the material to “a court that just appreciates the facts.”
    “The approach is very distant,” he said. “The visual style I did is also different. Static cinema…long takes.”
    Altajeros has directed gender-oriented films since 2007, including his last opus “Kasal,” which won Best Picture at the Cinemalaya Directors Showcase category in 2014.
    It seems he has now shifted gears and started to create films that explore violence against specific genders.

    T. P. O. is Altarejos’ second film that tackles domestic abuse. The first one, “Siklo”, which also stars Oliver Aquino, had its special screening at the 3rd Singkuwento International Film Festival last February.
    “I’m hoping to do the third one for the trilogy because after LGBT rights, what else is close to my heart than women and children’s rights,” he said.
    “There are a lot of victims of this phenomenon,” he said, noting the significance of digging into his chosen theme.
    “In T. P. O., I also show the psychology of the abuser because I believe, there will be no victim if there is no abuser,” the director explained.
    He recognized that people could never stop the cycle of abuse until they understand where it starts.
    “Domestic abuse doesn’t begin and end with the victim. I believe it begins and ends with the victimizer,” he said.
    Other cast members of T. P. O. are Dexter Doria, Menggie Cobarrubias, Yayo Aguila, Monti Parungao, Lex Bonife, Ray An Dulay, May delos Santos, Annelle Durano and Atty. Cecille Soria.
    The Sinag Maynila Film Festival will run from April 21-26 at SM Megamall, SM Aura Premier, SM North Edsa, SM Mall Of Asia and SM Manila.

    <content>Sinag Maynila: A risky adventure in Mes de Guzman’s ‘Dyamper’
    
    
    The word “dyamper” is commonly used by Filipinos to refer to a device that tampers with electrical consumption. But in Mes De Guzman’s Sinag Maynila entry, it takes a different meaning.
    The film “Dyamper” tells the story of three men who jump readily onto delivery trucks that ply the Dalton Pass, the gateway to Cagayan Valley.

    The characters do not jump for fun. Rather, they steal farm-produced crops and goods and sell it at the wet market to earn money.

    “These are my childhood stories. I’m from Nueva Vizcaya. I always see those trucks passing along the highway.  I carry those images with me,” writer and director De Guzman told INQUIRER.net.
    “That is how the germ of the idea started. And eventually it has developed,”  he said.
    Playing major roles in “Dyamper” are  Carlo Aquino, Alchris Galura, Timothy Mabalot, Liza Diño, Kristoffer King and Debbie Garcia.

    In the film, one of the main characters will discover something from the truck that will put him and his friends in jeopardy.
    “This is the most difficult film I’ve done in terms of logistics,” said the director as he related how hard it was to shoot scenes atop moving trucks along roads near the edge of the ravine.
    De Guzman is the director of award-winning films “Diablo” (Cinemalaya 2012), “Sitio” (Cinema One Originals 2013) and “Ang Kwento ni Mabuti” (CineFilipino 2013).
    There is something different in “Dyamper” that indie buffs  can look forward to, De Guzman assured.

    “The characters are adventurous. At the same time, the film got a dash of action. We also scouted beautiful locations,” he said.
    “I am impressed with our setting in Nueva Vizcaya,” actress Liza Diño shared. “I think it is where Direk Mes shot  almost all of his films because he wants to make regional films that put people’s rural lives at the forefront.”
    “For those who are in the city, they would get a glimpse of how people live and struggle in the province. Their life is not less interesting than what we have here,” she added.

    <content>Sinag Maynila’s ‘Mrs.’: The old and weary on amity, neglect
    
    
    A deep introspection of feelings of two women is what director Adolf Alix Jr.  tries to deliver in his film “Mrs.”
    The Sinag Maynila entry puts forward the acting prowess of veterans Elizabeth Oropesa and Lotlot de Leon in a domestic drama that mirrors life’s harsh realities.

    In the film, 70-year-old Virginia (Oropesa) can not bear to part with her ever loyal maid Delia (de Leon) who has decided to marry her long-time partner Rene and settle for good in the province.

    Virginia also tries to escape from her unconquerable past—the disappearance of her only son Sonny Boy.
    The story unfolds in an ancestral house located at an earthquake fault zone.
    Alix shared to INQUIRER.net how “Mrs.” had its birth.
    “My writer Ralston Jover and I had been talking about things when we came across a documentary that shows a village where houses sit on a fault line,” he said.
    “We thought it would make a good story for the film. Those people aged 50 and above who are left alone in their houses after their children move out.”
    That milieu, where homes are intermittently shaken by earthquake, according to Alix, alludes to the problems the characters of Oropesa and de Leon have to deal with.
    “While facing their problems, their inner demons are being unleashed,” he said.

    In 2008, Alix made a drama that tackles a story of a loving grandmother. “Adela,” played by the nonagenarian actress Anita Linda, earned numerous recognitions in local and international film festivals.
    The internationally acclaimed screenwriter and director said he has always thought of doing a sequel for Adela or making a movie with a similar theme.
    “Usually the films I make are about the youth. I thought that sector [elderly people] is being neglected. That is why I am thankful to Sinag Maynila for giving us the chance to pursue this kind of story which is seldom explored.”
    Alix said the portrayal of a family in “Mrs.” is what will ultimately appeal to the viewers.
    “The film isn’t very dramatic but you feel the dilemma of characters. Their small moments are what is important to me,” he said.
    The Sinag Maynila Film Festival will run from April 21-26 at SM Megamall, SM Aura Premier, SM North Edsa, SM Mall Of Asia and SM Manila.

    <content>Filipino fisherman’s tale highlighted in Cannes Critics’ Week
    
    
    Another staggering Filipino indie film will be reeled in a distinguished international movie competition.
    ‘Arnie’, a movie illustrating the life of a Filipino fisherman, made it to the ‘Short Films Competition’ in the upcoming International Critics Week, a sidebar competition at the Cannes Film Festival.
    The film, directed by Taiwanese-Filipino Rina Tsou, was shot in Cianjhen fishing port in the coastal province of Kaohsiung. It focused on the modest life of Arnie, a fisherman who ended up in the Taiwanese coast after swimming through the rough seas.

    Tsou’s entry will compete with other independent films, such as ‘Oh, What a Wonderful Feeling’ by Canadian director Francois Jaros, and ‘Prenjak’, an Indonesian film by Wregas Bhanuteja. Likewise, ‘Arnie’ will be featured with 11 other Taiwanese films in the Kaohsiung Film Festival.

    READ: ‘Diverse’ 2nd Sinag Maynila dawns this April
    “I said ‘Okay, game! Whatever the story is, whatever the movie is,” he told reporters at the festival’s media launch on Tuesday.
    Festival director Brillante Mendoza and Solar Entertainment CEO Wilson Tieng are the chief architects of Sinag Maynila which had its inaugural run in March last year.
    In Lila, Dee plays the cousin of Jess, the troubled main character portrayed by actress Janine Gutierrez from rival TV station GMA.

    “Piling-pili ‘yung mga projects ko na gustong gawin..nu’ng una sabi ko duguan ‘to and then I realized na ang ganda ng kwento,” he said.
    (I have been very selective with the projects that I want to do. At first, I thought it was going to be bloody and I realized that the story is beautiful.

    This, however is not Dee’s first foray into doing a horror film. In 2012, he starred in “The Strangers,” a Metro Manila Film Festival entry.
    One of the reasons he accepted to doing “Lila” was because he wants to fulfil one of his dreams as an actor.
    “Niloloko ko ‘yung mga production na please naman tuparin n’yo ‘yung pangarap ko na makapag-international film fest. Sana di ba? Lahat naman siguro ng aktor gusto makasali sa film festivals at magbigay ng honor sa Pilipinas.”
    (I was kidding the production people to help me fulfil my dream of joining an international film fest. I hope so. I think every actor wants to participate in film festivals and bring honor to the Philippines.)
    He recognized the necessity of having that deep acting repertoire the independent cinema requires.
    “Mas wide ‘yung kailangan mong pag-aralan, ‘yung kailangan mong matutunan; mas wide ‘yung dapat mong i-offer kasi ang laki nu’ng ginagalawan mong storya.”
    (The things you have to study and learn are more extensive; you have to have more to offer because the story requires it.)
    He also related how fun his experience was because of the youthful work environment. “Not only is the director young but also the production members…mas madali ‘yung paggawa ng pelikula (making the film is easier).”
    Dee also praised his co-star Gutierrez. “With Janine, sobrang natutuwa ako sa kanya. I didn’t realize that this is just her first movie, parang ang galing niya for her first (I am pleased with Janine. I didn’t realize this is her first movie. She seems really good for a first-timer).”
    “Maganda ‘yung discipline …’yung working attitude niya (Her discipline and working attitude are commendable),” he added.
    The Sinag Maynila film festival is slated to run from April 21-26 at selected SM cinemas.

    Contrary to speculations that ticket prices for Lav Diaz’s eight-hour film, “Hele Sa Hiwagang Hapis (Lullaby to a Sorrowful Mystery)” would cost the equivalent of four feature-length films or about P800, it turned out to be affordable even for students.
    It was announced via Cinema Bravo on Tuesday that tickets would be sold from P150 to P500, depending upon the venue.
    The length of “Hele” covers four regular shows of a two-hour feature film. To cover the cost, some sectors earlier thought cinemas would charge a prohibitive fee, from P800 to P1,000.  In Metro Manila, a regular rate ranges from P150 to P250.

    Of late, “Hele” has earned the label “eight-hour challenge” among regular film patrons. For the record, it is Diaz’s longest film to be shown in commercial cinemas. In August last year, his five-hour long “Norte: Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” was shown for a week in mainstream cinemas.

    Now being distributed by a major film outfit, Star Cinema, the latest opus of the iconic and probably the only authentic indie Filipino filmmaker will surely be an endurance test for its new audience, the fans who usually troop to a Piolo Pascual or John Lloyd Cruz-topbilled films.
    The two heartthrobs star in “Hele”, which many consider a first in the history of local cinema. Living rock legend Ely Buendia also plays a cameo.
    Even popular TV host Boy Abunda in his late-night talk show said he will take the “eight-hour challenge.”
    “Hele” combines history, folklore and social commentary in the classic Lav Diaz’ zen meditation-like cinematic style, for whatever that means, which gathered a cult following among cineastes and critics all over the world.
    It will be shown starting March 26, Black Saturday, in select cinemas nationwide. There’s a 30-minute break every three hours, as Diaz had earlier recommended to the producers and film distributors.

    HALF in earnest, half in jest, filmmaker Lemuel Lorca had his blood pressure checked by the on-site paramedic team after the CineFilipino Film Festival awards night, held on Saturday at the Kia Theatre in Quezon City.
    You can forgive Lorca for feeling a tad exhilarated, because his entry, “Ned’s Project,” had just romped away with six trophies—best picture, production design (JP Sapitula), screenplay (John Bedia), cinematography (Tey Clamor), supporting actress (Max Eigenmann) and actress (for Angeli Bayani, who played the titular heroine, a lesbian tattoo artist who wants to have a baby).
    A day after the ceremony, Lorca told the Inquirer: “The awards are just a bonus. The real prize is that we touched people’s lives—that we got to finish the film and see the audience laugh and cry.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Indeed, shooting “Ned’s Project” was an epic journey for Lorca—who had to report on the set hooked to a dextrose. In the middle of the shoot, he landed in the hospital due to a bum stomach.

    In his acceptance speech, he made a pitch for a safe and healthy working environment in the entertainment industry—echoing the sentiments of third best picture winner Randolph Longjas of “Star na si Van Damme Stallone.”
    Debuting director Ice Idanan was just as ecstatic as Lorca after her entry, “Sakaling Hindi Makarating,” won second best picture and six other trophies: best director and cinematographer (for Idanan), actor (Pepe Herrera), musical score (Mon Espia), sound (Raffy Magsaysay) and editor (Hannah Espia).
    “I only made this film because I wanted to tell a personal story,” Idanan said. “I am so glad that the efforts of our 15-man team were recognized.”
    Idanan, Clamor and (Hannah) Espia are among the female filmmakers who topped categories that were traditionally regarded as male-dominated.
    Madonna Tarrayo, festival director, said, “Skills, competence and creativity are genderless. And the festival has proven that both in front of and behind the camera, women rule!”
    Just as jubilant were best actress cowinners, Candy Pangilinan (“Van Damme Stallone”) and Bayani (“Ned’s Project”). Bayani dedicated her triumph to the LGBTQ community.

    <content>Unforgettable award for ‘Heneral Luna’
    
    
    IF YOU ask actor John Arcilla, this latest honor is the most unforgettable award he has ever received so far.
    Arcilla and the other crew members of the historical epic film, “Heneral Luna,” were feted at the Camp General Antonio Luna in Limay, Bataan, on March 8.
    “Camp Luna is also known as the Government Arsenal, an agency under the Department of National Defense,” Arcilla told the Inquirer. “It is where all the ammunition in the Philippines is manufactured.”

    Team “Heneral Luna” received a rousing welcome from the camp’s officials, led by Amelita Q. Omadto and Major Don de Dios.

    They were greeted by drum roll, trumpet-playing and a gun salute.
    Organizers awarded General Luna statuettes to producer Fernando Ortigas, scriptwriter Ed Rocha, director Jerrold Tarog and Arcilla.
    “The organizers told us that the General Luna award is the highest honor given by the Government Arsenal,” Arcilla related. “It was the first time that it was given to people who are not government officials.”
    The organizers wanted to recognize the film’s unique achievements—particularly, in reinvigorating nationalism, especially among the youth, he said.
    Arcilla, who toured the compound and the museum with costar Alvin Anson and other “Heneral Luna” staffers, scored a selfie with a huge solid brass statue of his screen alter ego.
    “The officers saluted me as if I were a real general,” he recounted. “I got misty-eyed, overwhelmed by a sense of joy, gratitude and pride.”
    Arcilla was also nominated for best actor and “Heneral Luna” for best production design and costume at the 10th Asian Film Awards, held in Macau on March 17.

    LAV DIAZ’S coming project, “When the Waves Are Gone,” won the 2016 Paris Co-Production Village Award at the 20th Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF). The prize comes with round-trip tickets and accommodation so that the filmmaker can attend the Paris Co-Production Village, which coincides with the Champs-Élysées Film Festival in June.
    Producer Bianca Balbuena explained that the HAF and Paris Co-Production Village “give filmmakers the opportunity to pitch their planned projects to prospective financiers, coproducers, sales agents and distributors.”
    She said that foreigners “are always looking forward to hear about the next project of Lav,” who had just won the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the Berlinale for “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis.”

    Balbuena, who is coproducing “When the Waves Are Gone” with Bradley Liew, related that it is a noirish film about “revenge, bloodshed and a femme fatale.”

    <content>Indie Bravo! Mercedes Cabral gets rave from Hollywood Reporter
    
    
    MERCEDES Cabral
    FILIPINO actress Mercedes Cabral earned a positive review from the Hollywood Reporter for her work in Frederikke Aspock’s “Rosita,” which was shown at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January.
    Critic Justin Lowe says of Cabral, who plays a mail-order bride in the film: She “nicely juxtaposes Rosita’s conflicting motivations for remaining in Denmark, progressing from hopeless confusion to feisty determination.” Cabral plays the titular character in the Danish film, which also features top European actors, Jens Albinus and Mikkel Boe Folsgaard.
    Lowe also describes the “low-key domestic drama,” thus: “Insightful and sometimes humorous… [it] captures the small-scale demographic shift as it impacts a northern Danish fishing village and the middle-aged widower who contemplates an arranged marriage to a younger woman from the Philippines.”

    BAMBANTI (SCARECROW)
    Fresh from the success of his full-length film “M. (Mother’s Maiden Name),” which won the Special Jury Prize in the 2014 Metro Manila Film Festival-New Wave Section, screenwriter and director Dulay is back with his latest opus, “Bambanti (Scarecrow)”.
    Shot during the week-long Bambanti festival in Isabela, the film is about the relationship of a mother and son, and their quest for truth incited by a missing watch.
    Dulay said the film, which has a dash of sadness, was inspired by his childhood experience.
    “Bambanti still pushes [the story] of affection towards our mothers,” said Dulay. “This time we use bambanti as a metaphor for mothers because scarecrows are used to protect the crops. In the film, just like bambanti, a mother will do anything to protect her child.”
    “The story is so simple, but has a heart,” added Dulay.

    The film stars Alessandra de Rossi, Micko Laurente, Julio Diaz, Shamaine Buencamino and Lui Manansala.
    Dulay was the director of “Huling Halik” (The Last Kiss), a NETPAC entry in the 2011 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival. He also wrote the screenplays for Lawrence Fajardo’s “Posas,” Ed Lejanos’ “QWERTY,” Armando Lao’s “Ad Ignorantiam,” Jeffrey Jeturian’s “Ekstra” and Jay Altarejos’ “Kasal.” His short film “Missing” was included in the official selection of the 2013 Cinemalaya Film Festival, short film category and won the Best Short Film in 2013 URIAN Awards.
    
     
     
    SWAP
    If you are into unique forms of action-drama, then Zuasola’s “Swap” is something you should never miss, with main actors Dionne Monsanto, Matt Daclan and Mon Confiado.
    “Swap” is a story of a young father torn between solving a crime and committing another crime. His only son is kidnapped and the criminals demand that he steal another child in exchange for his son’s life.
    The film, with the actors speaking in Cebuano language, is loosely based on real events, as Zuasola revealed that he was a kidnap victim as a child.
    “It is based on my parents’ recollection and from other people who were present when it happened,” said Zuasola.
    He says the movie has a touch of fantasy because he didn’t experience everything in it firsthand.
    The Cebu-based director says “Swap” induces a feeling of nostalgia.
    “When pain passed, it becomes joy. When you experience something painful in the past, and when you try to recall it, you feel happy that you got through it…that’s the effect of ‘Swap’,” he said.
    Zuasola also shared how he almost gave up because of the impossibility of making the movie, which was shot continuously in one hour and 30 minutes with no cuts.
    He directed more or less 40 actors, coming and going in five settings including a house, an army camp, a tailoring shop, a mansion and a hospital.
    He said: “I told them (the whole crew) ‘Brace yourself because we will suffer in this film. This is not an easy film to make but nonetheless we have to make it possible. We are not filmmakers, we are not artists. We are miracle makers.’”
    Zuasola is a recipient of the Ani ng Dangal Award for his dedication to the cultivation of modern Cebuano cinema. In 2009, he won the Ishmael Bernal Award for most outstanding young Filipino filmmaker for his short film “To Siomai Love” from the Cinemanila International Film Festival. His first feature length film “Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria” bagged top awards from Gawad Urian such as best picture, best cinematography, best musical score and best director. He recently showcased his second feature “Soap Opera” under Cinema One Originals Film Festival.
    
     
     
    IMBISIBOL
    Inspired from the one-act play written by Herlyn Gail Alegre for Virgin Labfest in 2013, Fajardo’s “Imbisibol” follows the lives of four Filipinos in Japan—Linda, Benjie, Manuel and Rodel.
    “Imbisibol” pertains to overseas Filipino workers, or ‘TNTs” (Tago nang Tago), the undocumented people who constantly change jobs and identities to elude immigration authorities. “Bilog,” which means zero, numberless or non-existent, is another monicker for them.
    The film presents a narrative of daily challenges faced by Filipinos in Japan during a period when thousands of undocumented workers and overstayers were being deported in response to strict Japanese laws.
    Amid their individual struggles, the characters will all be entangled in an agonizing game of hide and seek. They have to stay invisible,  for it is the only way to survive.
    As threats of arrest and deportation looms closer and everyone’s future becomes at stake, friendships are tested; loyalties are questioned; and values are eroded.
    JM De Guzman, Ces Quesada, Bernardo Bernardo, Allen Dizon and Ricky Davao lead the cast of “Imbisibol”.
    Fajardo says he wants to tell how desolate the lives of Filipinos abroad are.
    “They are the ones who do something illegal so they can do something good for the country and for their respective families,” he says.
    Fajardo, a Bacolod native, directed “Amok”, which won Best Sound and Editing at the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival in 2011. “Amok” was shown in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, USA, Canada and Italy. It also won Best Sound and Editing in the Natatanging Gawad Urian in 2012 and bagged the Special Prize of the Jury Award at the Detective Fest in Moscow, Russia in the same year.
    Fajardo’s other movie “Posas” was the Cinemalaya’s Best Film in the Director’s Showcase Category in 2012.  It was shown at 12 festivals in five continents around the globe. It became even more successful when it took home the Best Film award in the Hanoi International Film Festival in 2012.
    
     
     
    NINJA PARTY
    Libiran’s “Ninja Party” is the most daring if not the most controversial feature in the festival’s line-up.
    It is a coming of age, drama movie where teens get to discover and explore their identity and sexuality.
    The film is set in an elite Catholic high school, where some female students furtively join a secret orgy with anonymous boys. When rumors spread about their participation in the covert activity, they deal with the subsequent conflicts with themselves, their families and the school.
    Libiran relates how he was surprised with the performance of his chosen actors.
    “When it came to the point that they (the girls) are being run after by the school principal and their families, their dramatic acting is so excellent,” he said. “I believe their acting is partly  confessional and revelational in a way they let us boys see the hidden side of our culture.”
    Libiran says wild soirees among students has been an urban myth for years now. But a lot of people say these really happen, as attested to by some of his sources.
    He says he doesn’t like the stand of different institutions about premarital sex among teenagers.
    “Because when you say “No to sex”, and yet they do have sex, they just hide until they get pregnant or contacted STDs. That’s where the problem starts,” he said.
    “Society should have an open-mindedness about it … that sex is not bad,” he said. “This is a hidden aspect of our culture. We Filipinos must stop being hypocrites and show in full glory that yes, we are sexual.”
    “It is a social concern because if we do not discuss it, and we just prevent them from doing it, we just leave our children, our brothers and sisters, helpless,” he concluded.
    Among the members of the cast of “Ninja Party” are Annicka Dolonius, Julz Savard, Bea Galvez, Elora Espano, Mariz Reyes, Japo Parcero, Odette Khan, Teresa Loyzaga and Denise Marasigan.
    Jim Libiran directed the short film “Pancit Canton,” which was his directorial debut in 2006. His other full-length features are “Tribu” (2007) and “Happyland” (2010).

    BALUT COUNTRY
    Do you want to know a hidden story behind our favorite street food balut?
    In Sta. Ana’s “Balut Country,” actor Rocco Nacino plays the character of Jun, a bachelor who inherits a “balut” farm from his late father.
    He unexpectedly impregnates his girlfriend. And with his first child on the way, he decides to be practical and begins contemplating on selling the farm.
    But there are people who will be direly affected by his decision—the farm’s loyal caretakers, like Dado, played by Ronnie Quizon, who has toiled in the farm for a decade.
    Sta. Ana said the story was partly rooted in his experience.
    “My family has its own business but not necessarily a ‘balut’ farm,” he says. “When you are an artist usually you are more focused in your passions in life. You try as much as possible to be passionate about what your doing. But when your family leaves a business in your hands, it ignites your practicality, especially if your a man who wants to build your own family. You have to be practical in life.”
    Sta. Ana shares that the poetic approach to “Balut Country” is what differentiates it from his other masterpiece “Oros.”
    “‘Oros’ is very social realist. ‘Balut Country’ is very poetic since there are many objects that would symbolize something aside from the literal things. Most of the objects you’ll see in the film are metaphors,” he said.
    Sta. Ana says the Philippines is rich in culture but there are so many things left unexplored. He thinks the “balut” or duck egg industry must be used as a milieu and portrayed in another light.
    “We know what is ‘balut’. We know it is disgusting. But where does it come from? I think the international viewers would appreciate the ‘balut’ more if they get to see how it affects the lives of Filipinos,” he said.
    Sta. Ana is a Philosophy graduate at the Ateneo de Manila University. He is a writer and director of GMA Network. In 2010, he received a Balanghai trophy from the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival for “Mayohan.”  He has since earned nominations from the the Young Critics’ Circle, the Star Awards for Film and the Gawad Urian for his screenplays (Mayohan, Bisperas, Oros) and direction (Oros). His film Oros (The Coinbearer) was the opening film of the 2012 Asiatica Filmediale in Rome, Italy. It also won Best Film in the DC Independent Film Festival.

    <content>CineFilipino: Angeli Bayani plays a lesbian in ‘Ned’s Project’
    
    
    Notable in her striking portrayal of characters in Lav Diaz films, in the Singaporean much-awarded “Ilo-Ilo” and the late director Francis Xavier Pasion’s “Bwaya”, internationally acclaimed actress Angeli Bayani never imagined she would be wearing a skin of a lesbian tattoo artist.
    In Lemuel Lorca’s “Ned’s Project”, an entry to this year’s CineFilipino Film Festival, Bayani plays the role of a butch lesbian Henedina “Ned” De Asis, who has harbored a desire to have a baby.

    “I was hesitant to accept role. When I read the script, I find it so good. But I thought, it’s not me (the character), it’s not for me. And other actresses could give justice to the role,” she told INQUIRER.net.  “Finally, when I accepted it (the film), I had to psyche myself that I can do this!”

    But getting into the character is not a pushover, as Bayani said. She had to cut her hair short like a man and change her body movements, attitude and speech.
    “Cutting my hair was what I found bothersome. The character is based on a real-person. I should have worn a shorter hair than what I did in the film but I just appealed for a compromise so I could still go back in real life after the film,” she said gleefully.
    She shared she didn’t want to specifically mimic the personality of the real “Ned” so as not to strike as artificial. “I wanted to see or talk to her but not copy her because perhaps I would look like an impersonator and not an actress.”
    “I have lesbian friends. I understand them, their self-love, their love for women. The real challenge is not so much of conveying that love as getting my friends believe that I am one of their real members,” she explained.
    Bayani noted how she had no qualms in doing intimate scenes, kissing her two female costars Dionne Monsanto and Max Eigenmann. “For me, it’s a celebration of a woman’s body. At first I was ashamed of my body, because they (Monsanto, Eigenmann) are really sexy. But I overcame the feeling when I realize why I am doing the film. It’s not about me. It is about the story and what the characters are going through.”
    Gawad Urian best actress Angeli Bayani says her CineFilipino film “Ned’s Project” is more than just another LGBT movie. ARVIN MENDOZA
    In the film, Ned was dumped by her longtime girlfriend Gladys (Dionne Monsanto). Her older lesbian friend Max (Lui Manansala) also died. Fearing that she might grow old alone, she finally pursues her dream to be a mother.
    Bayani recalled how Ned had a hard time finding acceptance and love from her own family, notwithstanding her relationships with other women that make her get by.“Eventually she will realize she could never learn from  that kind of relationship with someone else if she herself couldn’t reconcile with her own ghosts, her unresolved family issues, her personal struggles.”

    “It’s an eye opener. So it’s more than just another LGBT movie. It has a lot to do with searching for yourself and your place in life. Sometimes people do a lot of crazy things just to be able to get to who they are supposed to be. It’s about Ned’s journey,” she said.
    When asked about how she personally feels about two women in love, she said, “Love takes work in every relationship. It’s one thing to fall in love to be attracted but to stay in love and to remain in a relationship requires hard work. And it also requires consciously loving each other everyday and respecting each other for who they are. I have no labels for it, two men or two women.  They are all just the same.”
    For its second edition this March 16-22, CineFilipino will showcase other  finalists in the feature-length competition: Alvin Yapan’s “Ang Tulay ng San Sebatian”; Carla Marie Baful’s “A Lotto Like Love”; Randolph Longjas’ “Van Damme Stallone”; Frank David Fabros’ “Straight to the Heart”; Ice Idanan’s “Sakaling Hindi Makarating”; Jason Paul Laxamana’s “Ang Taba Ko Kasi”; Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem”;  and Paolo Alessandro Herras’ “Buhay Habangbuhay”.

    “PERFUMED Nightmare”
    INDIE stalwart Kidlat Tahimik will give a talk and screen two of his films at the Courtisane Festival in Ghent, Belgium on March 20. His 1977 film, “Mababangong Bangungot (Perfumed Nightmare),” will be shown alongside his 1979 follow-up, “Who Invented the Yo-Yo? Who Invented the Moon Buggy?”
    According to the fest’s website, critic Fredric Jameson describes “Mababangong Bangungot,” thus: “A model example of how cinema could invent new geotopical cartographies within the landscape of late capitalism.”
    Meanwhile, critic Jason Sanders sums up “Who Invented the Yo-Yo?” as a “third-world space spectacle [that] blossoms with the energies of a creative mind willing to let itself go.”

    “Hele” recently won a major award, the Silver Alfred Bauer Award in the 2016 Berlinale  or the 66th Berlin International Film Festival.
    The festival jury president, Hollywood star and living film legend Meryl Streep, described the experience as something that “rearranged the molecules in her brain”.

    Critics hail it as “superb” and “a personal test of courage.”
    In return, co-producer Bianca Balbuena praised the Berlinale for allowing the film to be shown in competition for the main prize despite its length.
    “The Berlinale gave us the freedom, they didn’t ask us to cut down the length of the film,” she said in an earlier interview.

    It was reported earlier how inquisitive Streep and jury member Clive Owen were in the after-party event, asking questions to Diaz, musical director Erwin Romulo, actors John Lloyd Cruz, Piolo Pascual, Angel Aquino, Cherie Gil, Bernardo Bernardo, Susan Africa, among others.

    In the Philippines for the first time popular, TV talk show host and top commercial endorser Boy Abunda interviewed Diaz in his late-night talk show, together with the film’s co-producer Paul Soriano. Close observers said it’s rare for Abunda to feature someone as “anti-showbiz” like the punk director Diaz.
    Soriano said what prompted him to produce a Lav Diaz film was because of what he actually heard about Diaz in international film festivals. “He has a cult following and they talk about him as if he’s a legend. And after working with him, I found out it’s true.”
    Abunda asked Diaz about his and the crew members’ close encounter with the Academy Award winning veteran actress.
    “She told me she would like to watch it again, probably when “Hele” is shown in Los Angeles or New York,” Diaz told Abunda, who promised to see “Hele” in local cinemas.
    Star Cinema is the official distributor of “Hele”.

    <content>CineFilipino: ‘Ang Taba Ko Kasi’ spotlights tubby folks
    
    
    There had already been many films that featured famous stars in fat suit in an attempt to truly represent plump people. However, it is not the case for Jason Paul Laxamana’s “Ang Taba Ko Kasi,” an entry to the CineFilipino Film Festival this March.
    “In this film, we didn’t put prosthetics to our actors to make them look heavy. It’s not like an “Ugly Betty” who will eventually become sexy,” Laxamana told INQUIRER.net.

    “Ang Taba Ko Kasi” tells the story of a fat woman named Olga (Cai Cortez) who gets further motivation to lose weight because of her hot swimming instructor Noah (Mark Neumann). She will jog every afternoon until she meets Benji (Ryan Yllana), her weight loss buddy and a friend who will teach her life lessons.

    “It is much grounded on reality. It’s about emotional journey of a fat person who tries to find romantic relationship and at the same time coming into terms with self-acceptance,” the director said.
    Laxamana said a part of him is fused into the story and he made sure that it will be relatable to everyone. “I integrated stories of other people, my friends, what I see online and on TV.”
    He also shared that real-life, plus-size celebrities Cortez and Yllana are his first choices for the lead characters.

    Yllana felt really flattered. “I am very proud of this movie not because I was [cast in the role] but because [I] get to represent plus-size people like us in a movie that [no one] gets thinner in the ending.”
    “My role is very natural. I’m just being myself. The only struggle is that it is my first leading role and I had to take the lines by heart,” he added.

    As of posting time, the film’s trailer has already garnered more than 2.5 million views in less than two months after it was uploaded on Facebook.
    “It is my first time to be active in social media. I guess relatability is a very important director,” said Laxamana who is still fresh from the success of his romantic-comedy movie “Love Is Blind.”
    Though he has been previously lauded for award-winning independent films with serious undertone such as “Babagwa (Cinemalaya 2013)” and “Magkakabaung (MMFF New Wave 2014),” the director said he starts to enjoy different movie genres.
    “If given the chance, I would even love to do sci-fi. Perhaps that’s the geek in me wanting to do a lot of things. But lately, I am into comedy, especially when ‘Love is Blind’ became a hit,” he said.
    “With the passing of director Wenn (Deramas)…I am being pushed to make comedy films. I am nervous because in real life, I don’t see myself as a naturally funny person,” he shared.
    For its second edition this March 16 to 22, CineFilipino will showcase other finalists in the feature-length competition: Carla Marie Baful’s “A Lotto Like Love;” Randolph Longjas’ “Van Damme Stallone;” Frank David Fabros’ “Straight to the Heart;” Lemuel Lorca’s “Ned’s Project;” Ice Idanan’s “Sakaling Hindi Makarating;” Alvin Yapan’s “Ang Tulay ng San Sebastian;” Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem;” and Paolo Alessandro Herras’ “Buhay Habangbuhay.”

    <content>After sibling, ‘Matrix’ co-director comes out as transgender—report
    
    
    LOS ANGELES — “Matrix” co-director Andy Wachowski came out on Tuesday as transgender, giving her new name as Lilly, four years after directing partner and sister Lana made the same announcement.
    The 48-year-old made a statement to Chicago-based LGBT publication the Windy City Times, it reported, after she was approached by a reporter from British newspaper The Daily Mail.
    “Sex change shocker — Wachowski brothers now sisters!!!,” ran the headline of the filmmaker’s statement sent to the Times.

    “There’s the headline I’ve been waiting for this past year,” Wachowski wrote, recounting how several news outfits had threatened to out her against her will this past year.

    She said she was prompted to act after being approached at home this week by a reporter from the London-based Daily Mail.
    “He proceeded to explain… that I really had to sit down with him tomorrow or the next day or next week so that I could have my picture taken and tell my story which was so inspirational,” Wachowski said.
    “Being transgender is not easy. We live in a majority-enforced gender binary world,” she said.
    “This means when you’re transgender you have to face the hard reality of living the rest of your life in a world that is openly hostile to you.”
    Wachowksi confirmed that she had “transitioned” but didn’t specifically mention gender reassignment surgery.
    “I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly,” she said. “I just wanted — needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I don’t get to decide this.”
    Wachowski’s sister Lana, 50, publicly embraced her gender switch from Larry for the first time in 2012.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Her sex change had long been rumored but never confirmed, as she had previously avoided interviews and publicity tours by insisting on no-press clauses in her film contracts.
    A New Yorker article revealed that Larry separated from his then wife while shooting the last two installments of “The Matrix” trilogy after suffering from anxiety and depression over a long period.
    In 2009, Larry divorced, began living as transgendered Lana, and eventually married another woman.
    The Wachowskis made their first film together in 1996 but they are best known for the three Matrix movies starring Keanu Reeves, which netted more than $1.5 billion worldwide.
    Their back catalogue also includes “Cloud Atlas,” last year’s “Jupiter Ascending” and, as producers and writers, “V for Vendetta.”
    GLAAD, formerly the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said in a statement it was “thrilled” Lilly Wachowski had come out but added that she should not have been “forced to disclose her transgender identity before she was ready to do so.”

    <content>CineFilipino: ‘Ang Tulay ng San Sebastian’ set to sow terror
    
    
    Mythology and folklore have always been ingrained in the culture and psyche of Filipinos that when one happens to pass a deserted bridge in the middle of the night, his imagination runs wild.
    But what if those firmly held illusions of ghosts suddenly become real?
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    This is what the psychological-horror film “Ang Tulay ng San Sebastian” wants to explore just as it is set to sow terror in the upcoming CineFilipino Film Festival this month.

    Directed and written by Alvin Yapan, the film follows an ambulance driver and a nurse who are headed back home in the province, trying to keep each other awake by sharing road ghost stories in the midnight of Good Friday.
    In the story, Bong (Joem Bascon) and Francis (Sandino Martin) realize that the San Sebastian Bridge is haunted after seeing a white lady, a floating coffin and even a chilling reenactment of a massacre of passengers of a commercial bus line.
    Both men then traverse the bridge’s underbelly where they get separated and fight for their survival.
    “It is an all-out horror film,” Yapan told INQUIRER.net. “I want to dig into that psyche behind Filipinos’ belief in superstitions and mythical creatures, especially those involving a ‘road’.
    The film was shot in Puente de Malagonlong, one of the oldest bridges in the Philippines, also the longest one, built during the Spanish era in Tayabas, Quezon province.
    “Passing the same route again and again, white lady, tyanaks (mythical monster babies), (and) zombies. All elements of horror are in this film,” he said.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Yapan is the man behind the films “Ang Panggagahasa Kay Fe (Cinemalaya, 2009)” and “Mga Anino ng Kahapon” (MMFF New Wave, 2013) which were partly strewn with bits of fright.
    He said he has observed ghost stories are often connected to the fear men possess.
    
    Compared to his another award-winning indie “Ang Sayaw ng Dalawang Kaliwang Paa (Cinemalaya 2011)” that also features two men as lead characters, Yapan said he wanted to examine this time the things men are ultimately afraid of and how their fears would manifest as they pass along a creepy road.
    “I want to expose the weaknesses and anxiety of men when they lose control…their fear of the society, their fear of women and fellow men, their fear of relationships,” he said.
    Martin shared similar thoughts about the film.
    “It is a psychological-thriller because you won’t know what decisions the characters would make throughout the story. One is bold, the other one is coward,” he said. “You would see how these things would work out between two different men who are in the same boat and the same time, they are conflicting when it comes to personal interests.”
    “Meeting Joem and watching him perform changed my view of the script as an actor and my take of the story as a whole. That’s the best process for me—that we were able to give the film the psychological feel and we did it authentically,” he said.
    Though he found the role challenging because of the strenuous physical demands the film required, Bascon said he learned a lot from his amazing experience with Yapan.
    “We know how director Alvin creates scenes. You would think they are just normal events until you finish the whole movie and realize how things are interrelated. And he doesn’t give everything. You have to think what happened in the story and what its message is,” he said.
    For its second edition this March 16-22, CineFilipino will showcase other  finalists in the feature-length competition:  Carla Marie Baful’s “A Lotto Like Love”; Randolph Longjas’ “Van Damme Stallone”; Frank David Fabros’ “Straight to the Heart”; Lemuel Lorca’s “Ned’s Project”; Ice Idanan’s “Sakaling Hindi Makarating”; Jason Paul Laxamana’s “Ang Taba Ko Kasi”; Dexter Hemedez and Allan Ibañez’s “1st Sem”;   and Paolo Alessandro Herras’ “Buhay Habangbuhay”.

    JOHN Lloyd Cruz (left) and Piolo Pascual perfectly executed the vision of Lav Diaz (center).
    BERLIN—Filipino director Lav Diaz said movies should not be judged by their length, so he gave the Berlin Film Festival a historical drama about the Philippines that runs more than eight hours.
    “Hele Sa Hiwagang Hapis” (A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery) was shown in competition for the festival’s top Golden Bear prize in a screening that started at 9:30 a.m. and ended shortly before 7 p.m., with a one-hour lunch break.
    The film is similar to the duration of some other past festival favorites like Hungarian director Bela Tarr, whose “Satantango” clocks in at about seven hours.

    But at a post-screening news conference, Diaz rejected being labelled as a creator of “slow cinema.”

    Like poetry music
    “I don’t know why… every time we discourse on cinema we always focus on the length. It’s cinema, it’s just like poetry, just like music, just like painting where it’s free, whether it’s a small canvas or it’s a big canvas, it’s the same… So cinema shouldn’t be imposed on,” he said.
    Diaz’s movie is set in the late 19th century at the period of the Philippine revolution against Spanish rule and focuses on the influence of Andres Bonifacio y de Castro, considered to be one of the main motivators of the uprising.
    The film follows the lives of several groups of people, including Castro’s wife who is searching for his body on a mountain that is inhabited by people from the spirit world.
    It also follows the lives of several young men who get caught up in the revolution, including the poet Isagani (John Lloyd Cruz), who is so overwhelmed by the bloodshed that he loses faith in his ability to write poems.

    Freedom in Berlin
    Producer Bianca Balbuena praised the Berlinale for allowing the film to be shown in competition for the main prize despite its length.

    “The Berlinale gave us the freedom, they didn’t ask us to cut down the length of the film,” she said. “Thank you, Berlin.”
    The film is among the 18 films vying for the festival’s Golden Bear top prize, to be awarded by jury president Meryl Streep on Saturday.
    Diaz had told Agence France-Presse (AFP) before traveling to the German capital that his historical epic would be a “struggle” for the audience.
    But as the curtain closed at the 1,600-seat Berlinale Palace theater, more than half the audience was still present and rewarded the 57-year-old filmmaker with warm applause and cries of “bravo.”
    Test of courage
    Gerhard Reda, a German amateur filmmaker who said he watches 10 to 15 movies each week, called the screening a “personal test of courage.” He said he had started to watch another of Diaz’s notoriously lengthy films last year but had to give up after an hour.
    “He can have a 45-minute scene that just has people talking or walking through a field,” he said. “Some love him, some hate him but he’s always a challenge.”
    As the lights came up Thursday night, Taiwanese film critic Yun-hua Chen said that she was “doing absolutely fine.”
    “The film really needed to be this long so the audience can submerge in the story.”
    Enrico Cehovin, a 27-year-old Italian, said that playing long video games had prepared him for the experience, which he admitted was “only for cinema lovers.”
    “Despite its length, I wish I had learned more,” said Development worker Carla Schraml, 36, criticizing a meandering story that was only partly accessible for an uninitiated audience.
    But Hubert Speich, a critic for German public broadcaster SWR, called the picture “superb.”
    “He needs a canvas this size to tell the story he wants to tell in all its complexity in its historical sweep there is not a single shot that is excessive.” AFP

    DELA Cruz directs the cast of “Tibak.”
    YOU DON’T have to believe in the person’s ideals in order to make a film about him,” said independent filmmaker Arlyn dela Cruz, who is currently working on “Tibak,” the story of the 1960s youth group Kabataang Makabayan and its leader, Jose Ma. “Joma” Sison.
    “You just have to believe in their story and the idea that you can be a platform for them to make this known to many,” the director stressed.
    Dela Cruz is currently the news director of dzIQ Radyo Inquirer 990 AM. She’s also one of Inquirer’s correspondents-at-large and a columnist of its sister publication, Bandera.

    “Tibak: The Story of the Kabataang Makabayan” is Dela Cruz’s third full-length project. It features the younger years (1959-1969) of Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines.

    However, Dela Cruz stressed that “it is not solely focused on his life, but also about youth activism in that era with Joma as the leader.”
    Dela Cruz pointed out that “this is my interpretation of their story, based on what they told me. I was never an activist in my younger years, although as a reporter, I have covered a lot of the rallies they organized.”
    The director then explained why she decided to tell Sison’s story on the big screen. “I’ve been friends with Sison since 2008,” around the same time Dela Cruz agreed to produce “Puntod,” a film by Cesar Apolinario.
    “He told me that when it’s my turn to direct a movie, I should make his,” said Dela Cruz during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Singkuwento International Film Festival at the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in Intramuros, Manila.
    As part of her preparation, Dela Cruz read published literature about Sison and his group. “My work as a journalist enabled me to meet some of the members of the movement,” she said, citing names of key personalities such as National Democratic Front chief negotiator Luis Jalandoni and peace process panel member Fidel Agcaoili.
    Dela Cruz, who shot some scenes in The Netherlands where the 77-year-old political leader went into exile, said: “Joma never meddled with my work.” The film features Jak Roberto as Sison and Jill Placencia as Sison’s wife, Julie de Lima. It is set to be released in May, to coincide with Labor Day celebrations. Her film “Mandirigma” opens this month.

    Apart from Lav Diaz’s “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis,” another Berlin film topbills Filipinos. Axel Koenzen’s “Deadweight,” an entry in the Berlinale’s Forum section, features Archie Alemania in the lead. A German-Finnish production, the film centers on the guilt-ridden foreign captain of a container ship, with an all-Filipino crew, that encounters a fatal mishap. Koenzen cast Alemania after seeing him in Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Lav Diaz, Filipino maestro of painful film-viewing heads to Berlin
    
    
    Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz is flying to Berlin, Germany, to exhibit his 8-hour opus ‘A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery. INQUIRER FILE
    Daring Filipino director Lav Diaz brings his movie house of pain to Berlin this week, shooting for the top prize with an eight-hour epic that tests human patience and endurance.
    Diaz weaves the rich revolutionary history and mythology of his impoverished homeland in “A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery”, the longest film ever to compete at the Berlinale, but still three hours shorter than his longest work.

    “My principle is, the filmmaker shouldn’t struggle by himself…The viewer must struggle with me. Let’s experience this thing together and be immersed in this universe,” the 57-year-old Diaz told AFP in Manila before he left for Berlin.

    Festival organisers have inserted one interval into the epic, but Diaz is relaxed about how audiences will cope.
    “I understand the demands on the body, you need to defecate and urinate,” he says.
    “You’re free. You can go home and fuck your wife or marry your girlfriend, you come back the film is still rolling. It’s about life. Ultimately, cinema is about life itself.”
    “Lullaby” chronicles the futile search by Gregoria de Jesus — one of the few women leaders of the Philippine resistance against Spain — for the body of her husband, Andres Bonifacio, who was executed on a mountain by a rival faction of the rebellion.
    Diaz weaves into the narrative the legend of the Filipino Hercules, who is perpetually holding the edges of two mountains to keep them from crashing into each other, and also the “Tikbalang”, a cigar-puffing monster with the head of a horse and the body of a man.
    Another strand in the black and white movie is a retelling of “El Filibusterismo” a politically charged novel written during the Spanish period by the country’s national hero, Jose Rizal, to rouse nationalist spirit.
    “I combined all these threads, and when you view the film, it is about the search for the Filipino soul,” Diaz said.

    Soul cinema
    Diaz has won numerous international and local awards. One of his most recent works, the four-hour-long “Norte, the End of History”, was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.
    This year, a seven-member jury headed by three-time Academy Award winner Meryl Streep will select the winner of the Golden Bear, Berlinale’s top honour.
    But Diaz said he was not doing films to win awards or make money, but rather to help his countrymen find their national identity after centuries of colonisation by Spain and the United States, and more recently, a brutal dictatorship.
    “Until now, we’re searching for that soul. I don’t want to make films for the market, I want to contribute to my country,” Diaz said.
    Four metallic best picture trophies from the Filipino Critics’ Guild gather dust on his apartment shelf, beside a worn suitcase that has accompanied him on his many travels.
    Diaz, admitted his movies were “so long nobody would buy them” but added: “I am freeing cinema. My films are not long, they are free. I am not part of convention anymore.”
    He recalled a one-hour long scene in his 2006 film “Heremias”, where the entire shot followed three men getting high while they plot the rape of a woman.
    “It was my vision of hell… It questioned God, if you really are God, why did you let these demons rape this beautiful woman?” he said.
    Child of war
    Diaz said his filmmaking perspective was greatly influenced by his tumultuous childhood, growing up in the conflict-wracked southern town of Datu Paglas.
    His parents, both public school teachers, uprooted themselves from the peaceful north to teach children in war zones how to read and write. He fondly calls them “socialists”.
    As a child in the 1960s, Diaz said he and his father would take a bus to the city to spend the entire weekend watching films by Fernando Poe Jnr, considered the Philippines’ John Wayne.
    However, when their house was razed to the ground during crossfire between Muslim rebels and Christian militia groups, the family moved to a safe enclave while Diaz moved to Manila to study economics.
    Diaz worked as a waiter, a book salesman and a petrol pump attendant after college to support his wife and three children, but eventually pursued cinema, his first love.
    He started with low-budget skin flicks, including one about a woman who sleepwalks in the nude, before garnering critical acclaim.
    “I am a film addict. I love all kinds of cinema,” he said.
    While history and social injustice are running themes in his films, Diaz said the inspiration to start a project could strike anywhere.
    A trip to the national library in 1997 spawned “Lullaby”, after he stumbled upon a decaying handwritten note from Gregoria de Jesus, describing her 30-day search in the mountains.
    “I had an epiphany. I told myself: I have to make this film,” he said.
    And the inspiration for his next opus could literally be just outside his window.
    “You see that girl?” he said pointing to a beggar walking in front of a gleaming shopping mall.
    “Why is she poor? Why does society allow her to be poor?”

    Director Gianfranco Rosi, left, and protagonist Pietro Bartolo attend a press conference for the competition film ‘Fire At Sea’ at the 2016 Berlinale Film Festival in Berlin, Saturday, Feb. 13, 2016. AP
    BERLIN— The director of “Fire at Sea” — a documentary about the Italian island of Lampedusa, where thousands of asylum-seekers are arriving from lawless Libya — says he wanted “to show the tragedy that’s playing out in front of our eyes … We’re all responsible.”
    Director Gianfranco Rosi spoke after the film was screened Saturday at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it is one of two documentaries in competition for the prestigious Golden Bear award.
    The Italian director contrasts the native islanders’ everyday life with the arrival of the many men, women and children making the dangerous trip from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea on decrepit smugglers’ boats. Longing for freedom and prosperity, many of the migrants drown on the perilous passage to Europe, their dead bodies often pulled out of the water in Lampedusa.

    Rosi brings the viewer closer to the emotional world of some of the island’s inhabitants, who are exposed to a permanent state of emergency. He also shows the dead bodies of those who did not survive the journey to Europe.

    “This may be one of the biggest tragedies after the Holocaust that we are currently witnessing,” Rosi said.
    One of the film’s protagonists, Pietro Bartolo, told the audience that he’s been dealing with arriving refugees since they first started coming in the 1990s.
    “I’ve seen many dead children. I’ve seen many dead women, who had been raped … and that always leaves a hole in my stomach,” Bartolo said. “It’s horrible to remember this and often I’m haunted by nightmares.”
    He said he hoped that through the witness accounts in the documentary people with more power than him would do something to solve this “biggest contemporary problem of Europe.”
    A seven-member jury led by first-time festival jury chief Meryl Streep will announce the winners of the festival’s Golden Bear and various Silver Bear awards on Feb. 20. TVJ

    JOHN Arcilla

    <content>Lav’s journey to Berlin
    
    
    JOHN Lloyd Cruz (left) and Piolo Pascual perfectly executed the vision of Lav Diaz (center).
    ON THE eve of his film’s departure for the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale), acclaimed filmmaker Lav Diaz quietly reflected on the 17-year journey of his latest epic, “Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis”—an eight-hour, black-and-white meditation on the search for the missing body of revolutionary hero Andres Bonifacio.
    “The 17 years it took to complete this film seem like a dream now,” he told the Inquirer. “It was like waking up from a long slumber. I started work on this project in the late 1990s.”
    Flashback to the nation’s centennial celebrations in 1998 and 1999. Diaz recalled that he entered the script, then titled “Ang Dakilang Desaparecido,” in the Centennial Commission’s scriptwriting contest from 1998 to 1999.

    “There were 10 winners, to be awarded P5 million each. My script was one of the winners. The grand prize went to the late Mario O’Hara’s ‘La Loba Negra.’ We did preproduction, went location-hunting and conducted auditions. We were ready to shoot.”

    Then, one day, the winners found out that the “projects had been canceled,” Diaz related.
    Of course, it had also reached Diaz that a certain influential personality, related to Emilio Aguinaldo, was curiously involved in the commission. (Historical records implicated Aguinaldo in the execution of Bonifacio.)
    At first, it seemed Diaz’s film would meet the same destiny as its missing hero. Diaz, however, persevered. “I searched for funding. In 2005, I got a development [grant] from the Hubert Bals Fund.”
    Three years ago, producer Bianca Balbuena approached Diaz and casually asked if he had “a dream project” in mind. Balbuena then teamed up with producer Bich-Quan Tran and “explored various venues.”
    Then, in 2014, Filipino filmmaker Paul Soriano came on board as producer. Singaporean producers also provided a post-production grant, said Diaz. Jeremy Chua of Potocol and Fran Borgia of Akanga Film Asia are coproducers, too.
    It truly took a global village to finish the film.
    Throughout the 17-year “struggle to find financing,” Diaz kept researching and revising the script.

    Last July, filming officially commenced in “mystical” Lake Bulusan in Sorsogon—with a cast led by mainstream stars John Lloyd Cruz, Piolo Pascual, Cherie Gil and Alessandra de Rossi. (Star Cinema will distribute the film locally; Charo and Malou Santos are billed as executive producers.)

    Rough cut
    In December, Diaz finished a rough cut that was sent to the Berlinale, with the help of associate producer Paolo Bertolin and programmer John Badalu, Balbuena recounted.
    After “a long exchange of e-mails,” the good news came three days before Christmas. It was a fitting holiday present for the cast and crew.
    “Hele” was officially selected for the main competition of the Berlinale—one of the world’s top three film festivals (along with Venice and Cannes)—which will be held in Germany from Feb. 11 to 21. “Hele” is only the third Filipino film to compete in Berlinale’s main competition, after Ishmael Bernal’s “Himala” in 1982 and Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Captive” in 2012.
    “Shortly after, Films Boutique offered to be our sales agent,” said Balbuena.
    Diaz feels strongly about presenting this story to a global audience. “Our story is their story, too. They will see humanity’s struggle in the film.”
    “This is about our history and for that reason alone I felt the story needed to be told,” Soriano agreed.
    Diaz and the rest of the team will attend the red-carpet premiere on Feb. 18 at the Berlinale. “We heard it’s going to be very cold there, but we’ll just have fun, engage in discourse, watch a lot of cinema, check the snow, check the ice, attend some parties—and discover David Bowie’s Berlin,” Diaz asserted.
    He described the film, thus. “It’s our hele (lullaby) to our dear country. Mula sa Berlin, iduduyan natin ang bayan. (From Berlin, we will rock the country’s cradle.)”
    A Philippine premiere after Berlin is in the works, too. “I hope and pray Filipinos will want to see this film—that we be given the chance to screen in local cinemas. This film was made for Filipinos,” Soriano quipped.

    <content>John Lloyd Cruz seeks reform in MMFF, says House probe ‘beyond showbiz’
    
    
    John Lloyd Cruz shaves his head in a scene from “Honor Thy Father.”
    Actor John Lloyd Cruz on Wednesday appeared before the House of Representatives to attend the hearing on the disqualification of the film “Honor Thy Father” from the Best Picture race at the recent Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).
    Cruz, lead actor and also a co-producer of “Honor Thy Father,” said the House probe was an opportunity to institute reforms in the MMFF and the film industry, noting that the issue was beyond showbiz.

    The inquiry stemmed from a resolution filed by Laguna Rep. Dan Fernandez, a cast member who directed the MMFF executive committee to explain why the film was disqualified from the Best Picture category for its supposed non-disclosure of its participation in another film festival.

    “Nandito ako dahil mahal ko ang pelikulang Pilipino. Mahal ko siya dahil minahal din niya ako nang sobra sobra. Binigyan niya ako ng maraming magagandang karanasan… Hindi ito maliit na bagay. Hindi ito ka-showbizan lang. Importante itong nangyayari dito ngayon. Ang prosesong ito,” Cruz said in a statement that he read, a copy of which was published by Coconuts Manila.
    (I am here because I love the Philippine film industry. I love it because it loves me immensely. It gave me a lot of beautiful experiences…This is not small change. This is not mere show biz. What’s happening now is important. This process.)
    “Pagkakataon ito para magkaroon ng reporma sa MMFF. Ngayon napakainit ng issue na ito. Sana naman pagdating ng May at June, kung kailan pinipili ang mga susunod na entries ay may mga konkretong pagbabago na. Nang sa gayon, ang MMFF ay pagmulan ng inspirasyon sa halip sa pagdududa at kahihiyan,” he added.
    (This is a chance to have a reform at the MMFF. This is a very sensitive issue. Hopefully this coming May and June, when the next entries are chosen there will be concrete change. With that, the MMFF will be a source of inspiration not of doubt and shame.)
    Cruz said he was hoping that the House investigation would lead to the crafting of laws for the improvement of Philippine cinema.
    “’Wag sanang masayang ang pagkakataong ito na maguslat ng mga batas sa ikabubuti ng industriya. Suportahan sana ng ibang Congressman at ng Senado ang mga Congressman na pumunta dito at nagmalasakit sa atin. Pero malaking homework din para sa atin ito sa industriya. Maglaan tayo ng oras para magsulat ng mga position paper, makipag-usap sa mga Congressman, mangulit, makibalita, at makialam,” he said.

    Cruz also voiced out the need for more diverse choices of films for moviegoers, saying that there was a “huge opportunity” to develop an audience for local films.
    “Kung gaano karami ang iba’t ibang karanasan natin sa buhay, sana ganu’n din karami ang iba’t ibang klase ng pelikula… Ang dami nang mga Pinoy films ang nagtagumpay sa takilya na hindi inaasahan at noong una ay tinanggal pa nga sa sinehan at biglang binalik na lang dahil sa word of mouth na nagparami ng mgataong gustong manood,” Cruz said, citing films like “Heneral Luna,” “Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank,” and “Norte.
    “Ang punto ko lang ay: hindi kaya may malaking potential na maaring nawawala kapag hindi natin binibigyan ng espasyo ang iba’t ibang klase ng pelikula sa mga sinehan natin?”
    he added.
    In the end, Cruz said he was hoping that every Filipino, whether a member of the film industry or not, would take part in retalling the story of the race by embracing diversity and fighting for equal opportunities.
    “Kasi sa ating lahat ang pelikulang Pilipino. Tayo ito… Oo, marami tayong di pagkakaunawaan. Pero sigurado ako na gaya ko, andito rin kayo dahil mahal niyo ang pelikulang Pilipino. At kung may natutunan ako sa dinami-dami ng ginawa kong romantic movies, ‘yun ay: Ang mahal mo, ipaglalaban mo,” he said. TVJ

    Two films by Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz will be shown at the Harvard Film Archive today.
    Of “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan,” the HFA web site says, “Diaz’s mix of everyday episodes, moments of tenderness [and] sudden cataclysm startles and arrests.”
    Of “Florentina Hubaldo, CTE,” it notes: Its “brutality is a cry of anger at 300 years of colonial plunder and misrule.”

    Finally, fans of rogue director Erik Matti will be able to watch his latest opus, “Honor Thy Father.”
    Its lead actor, John Lloyd Cruz, announced on Thursday night it will open this year’s Cinema One Originals film festival on November 8 at Trinoma Mall cinema.
    Cruz was guest in Boy Abunda’s late-night talk show. Abunda asked Cruz what it is all about, if it’s drama, action or comedy.

    <content>Review: Charlie Kaufman’s ‘Anomalisa’ will break your heart
    
    
    This image released by Paramount pictures shows characters Michael Stone, voiced by David Thewlis, left, and Lisa Hesselman, voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh in a scene from the animated stop-motion film, “Anomalisa.” The film was nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated film on Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015. AP
    In “Anomalisa” everyone looks and sounds the same. They have the same face (Caucasian, bland, non-descript). They have the same voice (Tom Noonan’s). They bore our protagonist Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) to death. And this feeling that he’s the only individual on the planet among all these clones might be the cause of his unravelling.
    In this very R-rated stop-motion animated feature, scripted by Charlie Kaufman (writer of “Adaptation.” and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”) and co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson, we spend one day with this sad sack narcissist on an overnight trip to Cincinnati. He’s there to give a lecture about his book, “How May I Help You Help Them,” a top selling manifesto on the art of customer service. It’s successful enough that people in the hotel recognize him immediately.
    But he’s still sad. He has a stilted conversation with his wife and son who stayed behind in Los Angeles. He calls an ex-girlfriend to see if she’ll meet him for a drink. Their breakup was fraught, and so is this encounter.

    Back in his room, Michael sinks into himself, bereft of an easy hookup. It’s just him and his Belvedere martinis with a twist until he hears an alarming sound from the hotel hallway — a voice that’s not Tom Noonan’s. It’s Jennifer Jason Leigh’s. Michael bursts out of his room like the owner of this voice is his last chance for survival, frantically knocking on random hotel room doors to find her.

    The woman has travelled from Akron, Ohio, (over 200 miles) to hear him speak. She’s a big fan, as is her co-worker. And this woman is different in voice and face. Her name is Lisa. She’s an anomaly. She’s his Anoma-Lisa, he tells her later when things get intimate.
    Leigh’s nuanced vocals bring what could have been a slip of a character to life. It’s a stunning, emotionally truthful performance that makes you wish more awards would recognize voice acting.
    Lisa has the confidence of a middle school girl (read: none). Her levels might even be in the negative numbers. She is sweet and excitable and good-natured, but cripplingly self-conscious. She second-guesses everything she says. She ends sentences with “shut up Lisa!” She thinks she’s ugly, dumb and unsophisticated.
    Actually, Lisa is basically a girl in an adult woman’s body. She is gawky and awkward. She stumbles over her own feet and really likes to press the buttons in the elevator. But she still goes back to Michael’s room when he asks her to after a few drinks, knowing full well what that means.
    Director Charlie Kaufman attends a special screening of “Anomalisa” held at Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015, in Los Angeles. AP
    The story doesn’t willfully hide details from the viewer, but it does evolve in surprising ways. Even after two viewings, I can’t settle on a single thesis. That’s probably what makes it valuable.
    You can feel for Michael and empathize with his existential solitude, or you can roll your eyes at him. I did. He’s fairly insufferable, and it takes a while to realize that perhaps the problem isn’t everyone else — it’s him. He’s unable to see outside himself and condescends to others with abandon while profiting off of a customer service ideology that he clearly doesn’t believe — that everyone deserves to be loved, that everyone is an individual, that a smile costs nothing and can make a person’s day.
    There is little entertainment in watching a narcissist’s worldview realized. It’s more like heartbreaking dread. The fact that Kaufman (his follow up to “Synecdoche, New York”) and Johnson (his first feature) accomplished all of this with puppets is all the more astounding.

    “Anomalisa” is an anomaly. It’s distinctive, bold, and achingly human. Sometimes art needs to splash us with cold water to give us an experience that is not just passive enjoyment, but active introspection. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
    “Anomalisa,” a Paramount Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for “strong sexual content, graphic nudity and language.” Running time: 90 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. TVJ

    <content>Best director winner Erik Matti: Thank you MMFF for free publicity
    
    
    Director Erik Matti shares his thoughts about the his latest film “Honor Thy Father” at the opening night of Cinema One Originals 2015. ARVIN GAYE MENDOZA/INQUIRER.net
    “Let us demand for better films… Thank you MMFF for the free publicity,” controversial director Erik Matti on Sunday said in a message that he sent to the organizers of the 2015 Metro Manila Film Festival wherein his film “Honor Thy Father” is an official entry.
    Matti, who won the best director award, is a no-show. Instead, he made a female member of his crew read his speech. To the audience he said, “You deserve better… Di ako titigil kung ‘di kayo titigil (I won’t stop if you won’t stop).”
    Matti’s movie, starring John Lloyd Cruz, was disqualified from competing in the best picture category because of a violation of the MMFF rules and regulation, according to Metro Manila Development Authority chair Emerson Carlos.

    The MMDA is the host of the annual film event. In an interview prior to the awards ceremony at the newly built Kia Theater in Cubao, Quezon City, Carlos said “the Executive Committee decided to disqualify the movie from the best picture category for failure to disclose some material facts.”

    He added: “We’re just upholding the rule of law so that every film entry gets a fair treatment. (The producers) informed us of the screening on Nov. 4 or 5 but the material fact that was considered was the time they asked to come in as an official entry on Oct. 22 or 23. With that, they submitted certifications, stating among other things that they have not or will not participate in any festival other than the MMFF.”

    When she penned the script of her latest film “Mandirigma” (Warrior),  journalist-turned-director Arlyn de la Cruz never realized that it would be an omen for another imminent and real-life incident involving the commandos of the Philippine National Police’s Special Action Forces.
    The film, an entry to this year’s MMFF New Wave section, shows the lives of Philippine Marines as they wage war against the renegade forces in the Mindanao region.
    “It represents what happens with the Philippine Marines as they go to the frontlines. Sometimes they are victorious, sometimes they are defeated. Whatever the result of the mission, whether there’s a casualty or not, they still go on with their jobs” she said.

    According to de la Cruz, the main villain in the film was patterned after Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias “Marwan”, who was killed in the Philippine National Police operation that took the lives of 44 Special Action Force (SAF) troopers and reportedly 18 MILF fighters in January this year.

    “He is the most wanted terrorist at that time. I would like to highlight that the problem of terrorism has gone region wide that’s why there should be a character Hamda Marawan (portrayed by Mon Confiado),” she said.
    De la Cruz wrote the draft of the script in October  last year and finished the final revision in December, or about month before the Mamasapano incident took place.
    She said she has no knowledge that during that time, the authorities were already on the lookout for Marwan. It’s clear that she didn’t intend the film to be an allusion to the Mamasapano clash.
    “[The film] is a representation of some stories people might have heard in the previous wherein there were ambushes, beheadings and hostage takings the government soldiers have to face,” she said.
    “Kahit ilan malagas sa kanila, kahit gaano kasakit yun sa kanila (no matter how many fell [to their deaths], no matter how deep they were hurt [by their comrades’ demise], the following day is just another day sacrificing their lives.”
    Mandirigma poster
    She said “Mandirigma” is her way of giving tribute to men and women of the Philippine Marines and Armed Forces of the Philippines in general, who have been a big part of her journalistic experience for 25 years.
    Believing that credibility is a necessary element of filmmaking, de la Cruz said that before doing any film project, she ascertains that she has a good grasp of the story, especially one that she covered as a journalist.

    “I won’t make a film if I haven’t completely understood the story or I haven’t witnessed it from a personal experience. I want to do movies that highlight truths in the society…those which I can prove happened in real life,” she said.
    This view was also what prompted her to bring to life her directorial debut “Maratabat”, which was reminiscent of the Maguindanao massacre, the worst election-related violence in Philippine history.
    And with “Mandirigma”, she absolutely has a clear message to tell. “The soldiers and the rebels…Lahat sila may pinaglalaban…lahat sila may pinanggagalingan..(all of them have a cause to fight for…all of them came from somewhere…) there is no right or wrong sa perspective nila.”
    “This would lead to understanding war without condemning both parties. At makakahanap ang mga stake holders naten ng tamang approach on how to go about the problem kasi kung hindi maulit-ulit lamang ang lahat ng ito at hindi matatapos (And all the stakeholders will find the right approach on to how to go about the problem because if not, this will go on and on and will never end).”
    The MMFF New Wave 2015 will run from December 17 to 24 at SM Megamall, Glorietta 4 and Robinsons Place Manila. On its fifth year, the MMFF New Wave section showcases the works of indie filmmakers.  TVJ

    <content>Drama, comedy, music at 6th Inquirer indie awards
    
    
    The sixth Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards, held on Thursday at this paper’s Makati office, had all the ingredients of a groundbreaking, game-changing independent film—high drama, inadvertent comedy and heartfelt musical interludes.
    What began as a modest ceremony to honor the achievements of internationally acclaimed Filipino filmmakers has expanded and evolved but has remained unchanged at its very core.

    From the start, it has always served as the paper’s thanksgiving party for the accolades indie film community artists have received in film festivals abroad.

    This year, it honored 30 film artists, capping the weeklong celebrations of the Inquirer’s 30th anniversary.
    Inquirer chair Marixi Rufino-Prieto led the revelry, commending the honorees’ unique contributions to Philippine society.
    “Every time you win and bring home these international awards, you are giving back to your country and making the film industry brim with pride,” Prieto said.
    She said that in a lot of ways, indie filmmaking and the Inquirer share the same mission of telling the Filipino story, with courage beyond words.
    “We at the Inquirer tell Filipino stories through words, while [films] expose and narrate our society’s story through the visual medium. We always take delight in diversity of talent and this is what the Inquirer Indie Bravo! is all about.”
    Two of a kind
    In a message read by executive director Mike de la Rosa, Briccio Santos, chair of the Film Development Council of the Philippines, shared the same sentiment.

    “Like journalism, cinema is a medium for sparking change, spreading awareness and celebrating the human spirit,” he said.
    Quite by chance, the Inquirer’s coverage of the indie scene became its trademark in a very crowded and noisy entertainment scene.
    Relentless coverage
    Honoree Jeffrey Jeturian, in a message read by actress Ruby Ruiz during the ceremony, said: “Thank you to the Inquirer for its untiring support of indie filmmakers and for single-handedly bringing the indie film industry to the consciousness of the Filipino audience with its relentless coverage of… our achievements in various international film festivals.”
    In his acceptance speech, filmmaker Real Florido agreed: “The Inquirer has helped the industry immensely by serving as a platform that amplifies how greatly Filipino-made films are being recognized beyond our shores.”
    In his speech, Chris Millado, vice president of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, also took note of the Inquirer’s game-changing reportage. “Through its stimulating and sustained coverage… the public’s growing fascination of indie films has been fed… At first, we were surprised, but we were also secretly thrilled that ‘indie’ was now considered newsworthy.”
    In a video message, Eugenio “Toto” Villareal, chair of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board, lauded the Inquirer for its “initiative of paying tribute to Filipino artists.”
    “Indie filmmakers, artists, directors, writers… are the so-called little ones compared perhaps to those in the mainstream. Yet there in your littleness is your greatness,” he said.
    Ten years ago, the Philippine movie industry was dismissed as moribund, if not dead. Still, the Inquirer stubbornly chose to highlight the then-ignored indie scene. A decade later, the gambit has paid off.
    Inquirer Indie Bravo! was covered not only by the paper’s multiplatform team, but also by the country’s top three TV networks—ABS-CBN, TV5 and GMA 7.

    Growing A-list
    The ever-increasing number of honorees also proves that the indie film movement has come of age. A few days before the event, Remton Siega Zuasola’s “Swap” won silver in Indonesia. A day after the ceremony, Jun Robles Lana’s “Anino sa Likod ng Buwan” won best director in India.
    The honor roll keeps growing. In previous years, the list only included directors, actors and producers. Now, the lineup features unsung heroes of the film industry: a music scorer, a film editor and a scriptwriter.
    Music scorer Teresa Barrozo shared her trophy with other behind-the-scenes personnel. “I share with and dedicate this recognition to all the hard-working and devoted people in film postproduction.”
    Barrozo, who brought her mother Mina Lopez to the award show, can’t help getting weepy. “We have only each other in life. Seeing my mom’s reaction was priceless,” she said.
    Film editor Benjamin Tolentino acknowledged that being an Inquirer honoree was “a dream come true.”
    “Never in a million years did I imagine I’d ever get a Guyito because I thought it was only for directors and actors. Now, I am looking forward to the stories we will tell in the next 30 years. With the technology we have now, there are no more excuses,” Tolentino said.
    Filmmaker Gabby Fernandez made fellow awardee, actor Sid Lucero, emotional. In his speech, Fernandez thanked Lucero’s father, Mark Gil, who passed away last year. “Mark was a true friend,” Fernandez said.
    Deeply touched, Lucero was later seen hugging Fernandez in gratitude.
    Apart from sentimental honorees, former Entertainment editor Emmie G. Velarde also had a chance to wax nostalgic and bid farewell.
    Light moments
    It was not all serious speeches and high drama. The evening was marked by laughter and levity as well.
    Honoree Kiri Dalena recalled that when she won in Switzerland in 2013, she didn’t attend the ceremony “because I thought I had no chance … My moment finally came two years later.”
    Filmmaker Francis Xavier Pasion, who had just planed in from Laos where he attended the Luang Prabang fest, echoed everyone’s exasperation over the holiday rush.
    “I left the airport at 6 p.m. … the Christmas season traffic was at a standstill. It was a miracle that I was still able to catch the ceremony.” Pasion brought his proud parents to the annual event.
    Actress Aiko Melendez, in an Edwin Tan dress and stilettos, had to run up the Inquirer’s winding staircase, to get to the venue on the second floor. In her speech, she said she was still reeling from the stressful traffic jam that she had to endure for hours.
    Actor Allen Dizon had to sneak out of a taping in faraway Fairview, motor all the way to Makati and drive back to Quezon City after receiving his award and Guyito.
    Honoree Carlo Enciso Catu charmed the audience with his confession: “My family and I are simple people. My parents get excited every time they see my photo in the Inquirer. My father would not report for work, so he could spend the entire day informing our relatives and friends that I was featured in the newspaper.”
    The jokes kept coming even from honorees known for dramatic movies. Richard Gomez, in his acceptance speech, revealed that actors would willingly take drastic pay cuts in making indie films. “There’s very little budget. Sometimes I had to pay for the meals of the crew. But that’s OK.”
    Gomez said he felt elated seeing “different kinds of people gathered in the same room… like Kidlat Tahimik. We used to study his films in school (at the University of the Philippines in Diliman). I never thought I’d get to meet him.”
    Like a giddy groupie, Gomez made sure he scored a snapshot with the pioneering indie filmmaker before the evening ended.

    About 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the 6th Indie Bravo! Awards last Thursday at Inquirer’s multipurpose hall, the company’s chair, Marixi R. Prieto, looked at the empty seats and surmised, “Oh, they’re probably still stuck in the traffic.”
    Indeed, many of the guests were delayed by the monstrous jam that was reported in the news the following night. Still they trooped to the paper’s Makati office and filled the venue.
    In her speech, actress Aiko Melendez, who won in London and Manhattan for “Asintado,” jested that she was still feeling a little dizzy from enduring the horrible traffic.

    She considered the Indie Bravo! trophy and the Guyito stuffed toy an “early Christmas gift and birthday present.” The actress’ birthday is on Dec. 16.
    While trophies this year took on a new colorful design by Inquirer graphic artist Sam Calleja, it was the Guyito stuffed toy, which now sports overalls, that remained the most coveted souvenir among the guests. Guyito is the paper’s carabao mascot.
    “Everyone’s been thanking the Inquirer,” said acclaimed filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik. “But let me thank Guyito,” he added, putting the microphone close to stuffed animal’s mouth. The paper honored Tahimik for his Berlin triumph in February.
    Producer-director Perci Intalan, who was honored this year for his debut film “Dementia,” has been a regular presence at the event, usually to accompany his husband and fellow filmmaker, Jun Robles Lana—who was also honored this year for his triple victory in Vladivostok.
    This time, Intalan has his own award and Guyito. “I no longer have to share with Jun,” he quipped. Intalan also accepted the award of Lana, who is in Kerala, India, for yet another film fest.
    Meanwhile, Real Florido, who won in the United Kingdom and Canada for “1st Ko si Third,” put it succinctly: “Ang cute ni Guyito!”
    It was a night for movie and music lovers as well.

    For the first time a music scorer was honored. Awardee Teresa Barrozo won in Sitges for her work in “Kinatay.” Another first was the prize for film editor. It went to Benjamin Tolentino (who won in Malaysia for “Bendor”).
    Singer Noel Cabangon opened the ceremony with two songs from the movies: “Ang Buhay Nga Naman” from Soxie Topacio’s “Ded na si Lolo,” and Jose F. Lacaba and Ding Achacoso’s “Sangandaan” from “Sister Stella L.”
    Cooky Chua and Bayang Barrios also performed original Pilipino music: Gary Granada’s “Uunahin Ko Kayo” and Mike Villegas’ “Harinawa.”
    The setup inside the venue was relatively spruced up, too. There were moving headlights! But the atmosphere, as always, was genial, intimate, and at the same time, crackling with the awardees’ combined talents. And it was apparent that everyone in the cramped hall treated each other more than industry colleagues: They were, more importantly, fans.
    Tahimik made giddy fan boys out of acting honorees Richard Gomez and Sid Lucero.
    Young filmmaker Carlo Enciso Catu, who was cited for “Ari (My Life with a King),” was as thrilled about the Indie Bravo! trophy as he was excited about having a photo taken with Lucero. In his speech, Catu said he wanted a picture with Lucero, who generously granted the young filmmaker’s request.
    Another popular guest among snapshot hunters was “Heneral Luna” himself, John Arcilla, who regaled the audience with impassioned song numbers: Bienvenido Lumbera and Ryan Cayabyab’s “Nanaginip ang Puso” (from “Noli”) and Cayabyab and Jovy Miroy’s “Kung Minsan” (from “Fili”).
    The program ran for two hours, with each minute filled with laughter, rousing music and an overwhelming sense of camaraderie. But more than the frequent eruption of cheers and praises, what made the Inquirer Indie Bravo! an important celebration, said Florido, is its commitment to support Filipino films and filmmakers.
    “Thank you, Inquirer, for encouraging us to tell more stories!” Florido said.
    Tahimik, whose real name is Eric de Guia, showed his appreciation by gifting the Inquirer with a bamboo camera, which he said was “a metaphor for the Filipino POV (point of view).” He then challenged young filmmakers to “stay out of formulae… to respect the ‘indie-genius’ culture and its strengths.”
    He likewise posted a challenge to the Inquirer to make sure that “the voice of the people will not be stifled.”
    Meanwhile, Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) executive director Mike de la Rosa commended young indie filmmakers for “capturing the true human spirit” in their movies and the Inquirer for recognizing “the “immense talent of Filipino filmmakers and actors.”
    De la Rosa then announced the opening of another cinematheque, located in Manila, and the FDCP film museum this month. The other FDCP cinematheques—located in Baguio, Iloilo, Davao and Zamboanga—regularly offer free film screenings.
    Other speakers included former Entertainment editor Emmie G. Velarde and Cinemalaya festival director Chris Millado (who is also vice president and artistic director of the Cultural Center of the
    Philippines).
    Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) Chair Eugenio Villareal sent a video message. (It was the government agency’s Christmas party that same night.)
    It was also a time for some guests to try other careers.
    Ormoc City Rep. Lucy Torres, wife of honoree Gomez, was her husband’s official photographer that night; actress Bing Pimentel was her son Lucero’s shutterbug. Screenwriter-director Clodualdo del Mundo was both escort and photographer to daughter-honoree Ida Anita del Mundo.
    In her acceptance speech, the young Del Mundo said “people always ask me how it’s like to be following in my father’s footsteps. Now, I got ahead of him; I already have a Guyito.”

    A-list actors Richard Gomez and Sid Lucero are big stars in local show business but on Thursday night, they were fans openly showing their admiration for living film legend Kidlat Tahimik (silent lightning) at the 6th Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards.
    “When I was in film school, we studied Kidlat Tahimik’s works and only here at Inquirer I got to see him in person,” Gomez said upon receiving his best actor award for his role as a rogue cop in Michael Tuviera’s “The Janitor.”
    Tahimik was in the audience about to receive his award.

    Tahimik (real name Eric de Guia) is credited for starting independent filmmaking in the Philippines, long before the term was used.  He is referred to with various accolades like “Father of Filipino Indies,” “Founding Father of Filipino Indie Filmmaking” and “Father of Philippine Independent Cinema,” among others.

    In his first film, “Perfumed Nightmare” (1977) he was actor, scriptwriter, cinematographer and director. A story about a Filipino bus driver played by Tahimik dreams of going into Hollywood and embarks on a journey full of insightful misadventures. It has been shown and awarded in major international film festivals and has been subject of studies in film schools.
    Gomez in his younger years studied filmmaking at the University of the Philippines in Diliman.
    When it was Tahimik’s turn to receive his Indie Bravo award, he talked about his latest opus called “Balikbayan #1 Memories of Overdevelopment Redux III,” which he said is “35 years in the making”.
    Tahimik said it is about the first Filipino navigator in world history. The story goes that Ferdinand Magellan had a Filipino sailor on board his expedition but as how Tahimik explained, “he didn’t complete his journey around the world because he was killed by Lapu-Lapu.”
    “But our Filipino ‘balikbayan’ was able to continue the journey back to Spain and passing by other destinations so he navigated the world more than Magellan did,” Tahimik said.
    Lucero couldn’t help but indulge for some personal photos with Tahimik after a group shot of the first set of awardees was taken on stage. While other actors were finding their way back to their seats, Lucero took the time to pose beside Tahimik at the edge of the stage while his mother, actress Bing Pimentel, gamely took the role of photographer using her smartphone.

    Lucero is well-known for his award-winning roles in various indie films starting from Adolf Alix’s (2006) “Donsol” to Lav Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” (2014). He was last seen in Mario Cornejo and Monster Jimenez’s “Apocalypse Child,” which won best picture in this year’s QC International Film Festival.

    After Tahimik received his award, while giving an impromptu speech, in return he gave “Guyito” his signature Bamboo Camera award. Guyito is the carabao mascot of the Inquirer.
    “Because the Philippine Daily Inquirer is also fearless in supporting independent cinema at a time when no one was paying attention to it. And even up to now the support continues. So I am giving my bamboo camera award to ‘Guyito’,” Tahimik said.
    Tahimik cited the theme of PDI’s 30th anniversary, “Courage Beyond Words”.
    “I wish the Inquirer will continue to be fearless in the next 30 years,” he said.
    Other awardees present were Aiko Melendez, John Arcilla, Jaime Fabregas, Miggs Cuaderno and Allen Dizon.
    Guest of honor for the night was Emmie Velarde, the purveryor of Indie Bravo Awards. She recently retired as entertainment editor of the PDI. When she was on board, she made sure the indie filmmakers get ample coverage in her pages, while other media outlets and broadsheets were more focused on the mainstream cinema.  “Any news about you was a shot in the arm of our section,” she once said in the previous awards night.
    Guest of honor Emmie Velarde was one of the founders and prime movers of Inquirer Indie Bravo. She recently retired as PDI’s entertainment editor but continues to support indie filmmaking.

    <content>Erik Matti’s ‘Honor Thy Father’ premieres in Toronto
    
    
    The much-awaited film by Erik Matti, “Honor Thy Father”, will have its world premiere in this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, Matti announced in his official Facebook account Wednesday.
    “Honor Thy Father” has John Lloyd Cruz in his first lead role in an indie film. It is described a suspense thriller, about “a pair of married white-collar swindlers clashing with their latest victims.”

    With Cruz in the film are Meryl Soriano and Tirso Cruz III.
    “Honor Thy Father” was recently in the news after it was reportedly excluded in this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival.
    It was because of this film why Cruz shaved his head despite stern warnings from his big studio handlers that he might lose endorsement contracts, especially for a shampoo product.
    In an article by INQUIRER entertainment columnist Dolly Ann Carvajal, he explained his decision to break away from the usual leading man role.
    “My world has grown bigger. I am not just confined to my home network, ABS-CBN. I want to break away from my usual roles. I refuse to be typecast,” he said.
    “It’s hard to fight for your craft. Erik Matti’s ‘(Honor Thy Father)’ will serve as an eye-opener since it’s an unusual project. I want people to have a different perception of the John Lloyd they’ve gotten used to,” he added.

    <content>John Lloyd displays range in ‘Honor Thy Father,’ says Erik Matti
    
    
    Expressing his pride in signing up a sought-after leading man for his latest movie, internationally acclaimed director Erik Matti said that “Honor Thy Father” shows John Lloyd Cruz’ real “range” as an actor.
    “We have so many good actors, whose career has ended and yet we haven’t seen their range,” said Matti on Sunday in an interview during the opening ceremonies of Cinema One Originals Festival 2015 at Trinoma, Quezon City.

    “One of the ambitions of this film is that if John Lloyd is going to do only one movie which is straying from what he normally does, it has to be worth his while and that it should show his range as an actor,” he said. “Range in terms of, he [plays in] a really heavy emotional story wherein he carries the story all by himself.”
    Matti is proud that he was able to feature John Lloyd in the actor’s first-time attempt to break free from his usual roles. “This is what we came up with [for him]. Everything that John Lloyd cannot do in mainstream is all in the movie.”

    “Honor Thy Father  (Conman)” is one of the entries in the Metro Manila Film Festival this December. It was initially snubbed by the festival, but was invited back in after Gil Portes’ “Hermano Pule” backed out.
    Matti clarified the reason behind the film’s name change from “Honor Thy Father” to “Conman.”
    “The original title that we placed there was Conman but when we were accepted in Toronto International Film Festival, we decided to change the title to Honor Thy Father,” he explained. “For Christmas, we felt that it would be okay to get the title back to Conman so people would have a better understanding of what the film is about.”

    The film, a brazen crime-drama addressing serious social issues, narrates the story of Edgar (John Lloyd) who is forced to go back to his past racket as an acetylene gang member to rob a church its money to save his family from a troubled situation caused by a fraudulent investment scam.
    Matti confessed that the project is personal for him because of his own convictions and insights embedded on the film.
    “I hope that people will identify with the story. That they would find the characters intriguing, even the sectors of the society we were tackling, because in reality many of us deceive and are being deceived,” he said.
    He also denied that Honor Thy Father alludes to a specific religious institution when in the story, the character of Tirso Cruz III plays corrupt bishop of a Pentecostal church who extorts money from parishioners.
    “Right now in the modern world, crimes are already legit…multi-level marketing…the church. And we even look down on people like acetylene gang for example because they are out-and-out criminals, but actually they are all the same. [But] we really don’t want to be judgmental about it,” he declared. IDL

    Actor John Lloyd Cruz is unfazed that his latest crime-drama movie “Honor Thy Father (Conman)” may not appeal to the taste of his fans.
    The film, directed by Erik Matti, opened the Cinema One Originals Festival 2015 which officially commenced on Sunday at Trinoma, Quezon City.

    “Whether they like it or not, for me that’s not the point at all. We just wanted to tell a story,” said John Lloyd in an interview.
    Patronized by his supporters for his memorable romantic comedy and drama projects, John Lloyd is excited to know if his fans are ready to see him in a different  genre.
    “I want to know if they are ready. At the end of the day, it’s just cinema. And I happen to be an actor. Where else would I appear but on films?” he said.
    “We have been hearing from people that they want something new, something fresh. This is the good answer. If that’s what you want, then you might want to consider watching this film,” he said.
    “Honor Thy Father,” which will adopt the new title “Conman” for this year’s Metro Manila Film Festival, tells the story of a married couple Edgar (John Lloyd) and Kaye (Meryll Soriano) who find themselves in a miserable situation after getting embroiled in a Ponzi scheme, a deceitful investment operation.
    The film first premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last September.

    John Lloyd, who is more identified to his blockbuster mainstream projects, downplayed the idea that his appearance on an independent film signals a career move. “I just wanted to make a film and be a part of the cinema and this art. So when I got invited to be a part of it, that’s really all I’m after,” he said.

    It was the first time John Lloyd starred in an independent film. He admitted that he found it challenging to adjust during the filming process.
    “The changes that I had to face were hard especially when we started filming. Of course the beat is different and it was my first time with Direk Erik. The adjustment period is tough,” he said.
    In the film, John Lloyd did several emotional heavy scenes and even shaved his head in just one take. He was also seen digging through a tunnel in his robbery attempt as an acetylene gang member. IDL

    Synopsis: 
    In an old house replete with images of Catholic icons and symbols, a young lady struggles with the demented religious fanaticism of her mother, who seems like she cannot differentiate between pious fervor and demonic possession- for both exist simultaneously in her being. The daughter seeks help for her mother’s behavior, but as days go by, their relationship turns from harrowing to horrific, as a strange phenomenon occurs inside the house, driving the daughter to evade and overcome her mother’s deranged machinations.

Depicting the “inner world” of this canonical writer–who wrote both novels as well as journalistic works–the juxtaposition of documentary interviews, episodes from his life, and evocative imagery from his literary pieces will create a cinematic collage.

    Lav Diaz’s acclaimed film “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” was released by distributor Shellac in France, where it will be shown for a month in theaters.
    The Filipino filmmaker recently traveled to France and met with distributor Thomas Shellac and programmer Antoine Thirion at MK2 Beaubourg.
    Thirion programmed “Lav Diaz: The Very Rich Hours,” a retrospective of the Filipino director’s films, at Jeu de Paume.

    What would you like to give to, and receive from, your family and friends this year?
    Actress Dindi Gallardo, who makes a comeback as Imelda Marcos in the Cinema One entry Sari Dalena’s “Dahling Nick,” told the Inquirer: “I honestly don’t expect material gifts for Christmas…from anyone. For the past 18 years, I have given out Christmas presents mostly to children (my nieces, nephews and godchildren). For family and friends, I have planned potluck dinners and I have often cooked for a few friends, too. I have asked for their time or money to support a good cause and I have offered mine as well. There are so many ways to ‘give’ and experience the true meaning of Christmas.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>‘Flotsam’ movie shows beauty of La Union and stars’ bodies
    
    
    When Ilonggo filmmaker Jay Abello first basked in La Union sun, he instantly fell in love with the place. And after discovering its beautiful and gratifying beaches, sunset and waves, he just kept on coming back.
    His love of surfing and affection for everything about Surf Town in San Juan inspired him to create his dream film “Flotsam,” top-billed by Solenn Heusaff and Rocco Nacino.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “I remember the first weekend I went [to La Union], I was there to shoot a documentary on surfing with another group of friends,” Jay shared in an interview with INQUIRER.net. “I always go there. I’ve been there for one year.  That very first week, I wrote three short film scripts. One was making coffee, one was making pizza and the other was waiting for the waves.”

    The Flotsam and Jetsam, a quaint artist beach hostel where Jay stays, has become his second home and, inevitably, the most apt setting for his new film.
    He joined forces with La Union’s local artists and musicians to bring to life an anthology of eight, different love stories of real people living, coming from or going to Surf Town.

    For Jay, “Flotsam” is not a surf film or a film on surfing. It’s about the people and what happens to them, especially when the waves are “flat.”
    “The main character is the hostel because everything happens around there. When you’re there, it’s like you are in a different world,” he declared.
    “[Surf Town] is not only for surfing. That is something so great to share. Your first impression to surfing is that it’s only for the rich until you get there and say ‘The rock stars of surfing are the locals!’ Whether you are an actor or a director, you are all equal,” he said.

    The script and music
    
    Jay wrote the script of “Flotsam” with Mickeygirl Galang, a writer who has lived in San Juan for 10 years and whom the filmmaker trusted to capture the local daily life.
    One distinct element of the film, he said, is its language written predominantly in English. “At first, we said ‘Wow! We just wrote our really ‘conyo’ film.”
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    “It’s not that we don’t care about the audience. But we want to write Flotsam the way we see it. Later on, I developed two characters that I really fell in love with,” he said.
    He was referring to “Angelo” and “Marie” (played by Adrian Cabido and Barbara Miguel), two childhood best friends whose innocence and sincere expressions of love are expected to give the story most of its color and cuteness.
    “They are the locals and they kind of narrate the whole film,” he said.

    People’s experience of La Union’s Surf Town, meanwhile, won’t be complete without filling the soul with beach music.
    Because “Flotsam” is a romantic film with a lot of music, as Jay said, 10 original songs were written for the story to further elicit funky and sexy vibes.
    This is the result of a heartfelt collaboration with local artists and musicians, including the Flotsam and Jetsam hostel founders, Joncy Sumulong and Mia Sebastian, coffee shop owner Kiddo Cosio, Eraserheads’ guitarist Marcus Adoro, Bo Bismark and Wendell Garcia.
    The songs are sung live in the film, recorded during actual jamming sessions to truly showcase the musicality of the place. Performances also came from cast members such as Marc Abaya, Solenn Heusaff, Carla Humphries, Franco Daza and Julia Quizumbing.
    “It’s a fun movie. It’s light but you’ll find meaning in it. I believe that it will touch you in some way. It will make you laugh, make you cry and inspire you to write your own songs or live your own songs,” Mia said.

    Bonding and bikinis
    
    In the movie, Solenn plays Kai, a work-obsessed overachiever who decides to have a retreat from her lonely relationship with fiancé JV (Gerard Sison).  She would meet Tisoy (Rocco Nacino), the hostel bartender, and they engage in a summer fling.
    For Solenn, what makes “Flotsam” relatable is the special bond that the characters formed. “Nowadays people are scared to approach other people because we have become so cliquish and clannish as human beings.”
    “So this movie helps you remind that we are all the same. No matter what we do, whatever job we have, we are all the same people. And we should just be there for one another,” she said.

    “(Flotsam) is a different movie. The sceneries are beautiful. The surfing lifestyle, you’ll get to know it. It just shows the beauty of bonding over singing, laughter, jumping into the water and girls in bikinis,” she said.
    “The movie represents different types of love. Even if there’s hurt and pain, it also shows that pain brings a lot of beauty. And that friendship and living in the moment makes life beautiful,” she added.

    Mia is proud of the creativity, collaboration and closeness their hostel has inspired. She was an urban professional in Manila until she moved to La Union in 2011 and started to embrace a peaceful and fulfilling life.
    “Now the story is not anymore our own. It’s the other people making their own stories. I hope to inspire people to think out of the box, to get out of Manila, to find (themselves), to create, to find love and to surf,” she said.

    “Flotsam” also stars Mara Lopez, Jun King Austria, Zach Vacaris and local actors Lemon Supertar Dines and Jeff Ortega. It opens November 4 in cinemas nationwide. CB

    Dominic Du, executive committee member of the Metro Manila Film Festival, told the Inquirer that Gil Portes’ “Hermano Puli” has pulled out of the December event. Du said that Erik Matti’s “Conman,” also known as “Honor Thy Father,” will take over the slot vacated by “Puli.” “Honor Thy Father” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received a favorable review from the Hollywood Reporter, last September.

    <content>Spanish Film Festival 2015 second leg goes to Intramuros
    
    
    From October 19 to 25, Pelicula-Pelikula, the Spanish Film Festival featuring the best of Spanish and Latin American cinema, will continue with a second leg at Intramuros. Presented by Instituto Cervantes, the Embassy of Spain-AECID, the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), Intramuros Administration, and the NCCA, the second run of the Spanish Film Festival will screen 16 full-length films and 5 short films.
    After its first leg in Greenbelt 3 Cinemas, and as a great novelty in this year’s edition, Pelicula invites the public of Manila to enjoy more movies in the second leg of the Festival, which will be free of charge and will be held in the NCCA Building, Intramuros.
    From 19 to 25 October, the halls of the NCCA will host the exhibition entitled “Spanish Cinema in 20 Posters”, a journey through the history of Spanish cinema by means of the posters of some of its most emblematic films, encouraging one to reflect on its history and to be inspired by the beauty of the advertising graphics, illuminating the visual style of the different cinematic periods.

    Pelicula is not just a caucus for Spanish cinema, but also offers a look into Latin American cinema and the voices emerging from a continent that mainly expresses itself in Spanish. Colombian cinema is one of the most interesting and dynamic of its kind in Latin America. On October 24, thanks to the collaboration of the Embassy of Colombia in Manila, the Festival will dedicate a whole day screening session of recent Colombian productions, showing “Cazando luciérnagas” (2013), the documentary “Gabo: la magia de lo real” (2015) and the multi-awarded feature film “Los hongos” (2014).
    Presented by Instituto Cervantes, the Embassy of Spain–Aecid, the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), Intramuros Administration, and Ayala Malls Cinemas, Pelicula is made possible by Maersk, Rustan’s, NCCA, Emperador Distillers, Ayala Malls Cinemas &amp; Greenbelt, Vibal Foundation, Qatar Airways, Buzz Productions, and the Spanish Chamber of Commerce, in collaboration with Ayala Museum, the Embassy of Argentina, the Embassy of Mexico, the Embassy of the Czech Republic, the Embassy of Colombia, Bodegas Vivanco and Barcino.
    THE HOLLYWOOD Reporter describes “Living Is Easy with Eyes Closed” as a “small gem.” It opens the 2nd leg of Pelicula Spanish Film Festival at the NCCA building, Intramuros on Monday, October 19. CONTRIBUTED IMAGE

    <content>Award-winning Iranian filmmaker gets 6-year prison sentence
    
    
    DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An award-winning Iranian filmmaker whose work focuses on both the travails of modern life and political expression in the Islamic Republic has been sentenced to six years in prison over his movies.
    Both filmmaker Keywan Karimi and his lawyer Amir Raeisian say a court sentenced him on charges of “insulting sanctities” in Iran, whose elected government is ultimately overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
    They say the footage involved both a “video clip” and a film he directed called “Writing on the City,” which focuses on political graffiti in Tehran during its 1979 Islamic Revolution and following its contested 2009 election.

    It also competed in the Locarno fest this year. “I was supposed to attend the fest but I had work here,” Manatad told the Inquirer. “ When I checked the website, I got surprised.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Remember the landmark, now-classic Mexican film “Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too)” and its lead actors Gael Garcia-Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verdu?
    The coming-of-age, road movie in 2001 by Alfonso Cuaron propelled the careers of the three actors to international acclaim. Garcia-Bernal and Luna became instant heartthrobs and landed roles in major Hollywood and some art-house European movies.
    Verdu went on to do more mind-bending blockbusters like director Guillermo del Torro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth,” Pablo Berger’s black-and-white fantasy “Blancanieves” and most recent, Gracia Querejeta’s comedy-drama “Felices 140.”

    The good news is, Verdu is coming to the Philippines this month to grace the annual “Pelicula: Manila Spanish Film Festival”, the local Spanish cultural arm announced recently.

    Instituto Cervantes de Manila said Verdu will present two of her recent films (“Blancanieves” and “Felices 140”) on October 9, the second day of the festival. “Pelicula” happens from October 8 to 18 at Greenbelt 3 cinemas.
    Verdu’s presence is part of the annual tradition to bring in foreign actresses and filmmakers in the festival.

    Verdu will have an open forum after the screenings, which start at 4 pm for “Blancanieves” and 7 pm for “Felices 140.”
    Verdu was born in Madrid on October 2, 1970. She has worked with some of the best directors in Spanish cinema, such as José Luis Garci in “Canción de cuna; Bigas Luna in “Huevos de Oro”; Fernando Trueba in the Academy Award-winning film “Belle Époque” (1992); Carlos Saura in “Goya en Burdeos”; Gonzalo Suárez in “Oviedo Express” and a lot more.
    She has also worked with Francis Ford Coppola in “Tetro” (2009).
    Nominated seven times for the Goya Awards, she finally received the Best Actress award for her role in “Siete mesas de billar francés” (2007) on her fifth nomination.

    Meanwhile on October 12 at 9:30 pm, Spanish journalist Ramón Vilaró will present his film, “De aliados a masacrados” (2014), a documentary about how the Filipino-Spanish population of Manila was decimated during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War.
    On October 13, the Czech filmmaker Lenka Kny will present her comedy “Milagro en Praga” (2013), and will have an open forum after the screening. The romantic comedy film is about two families, a Mexican family and a Czech family, who cross paths in Prague over the Christmas holidays. The screening is co-presented by the Embassy of Mexico and the Embassy of the Czech Republic.
    The line-up of films shows a list of genres ranging from romance and comedy (“Ocho apellidos vascos,” T”res bodas de más,” “Gente en sitios”) to documentary (“Paco de Lucía,” “La plaga”), suspense (“Relatos salvajes”) and drama (“Hermosa juventud,” “Artico”).
    The festival will have a second leg in Intramuros from October 19 to 25.
    There will be an exhibit titled “Spanish Cinema in 20 Posters,” which will be  displayed at the NCCA Building, alongside the film screenings.
    The exhibit explores Spanish cinema by means of the posters of some of its most emblematic films, from the 1953 film “Bienvenido Míster Marshall” to the 2012 film “Blancanieves,” encouraging one to reflect on its history and to be inspired by the beauty of the advertising graphics, illuminating the visual style of the different cinematic periods. The second leg of Pelicula is made possible by Intramuros Administration and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.
    With the help of of the Film Development Council of the Philippines, a selection of films shown in the Manila leg of the festival will travel to the cities of Baguio, Ilo-ilo, Zamboanga and Davao.

    <content>INQUIRER.net poll: The most striking ‘Heneral Luna’ quote is…
    
    
    THE ACTOR describes “Heneral Luna” as “serious, witty, dramatic” and done “naturally,” not “stylized.”
    Jerrold Tarog’s historical epic “Heneral Luna,” perhaps the most talked about film today after being chosen as the Philippines’ bet in the 2016 Academy Awards, has not only posed thought-provoking questions to its viewers, but also left them stuck with a lot of quotable quotes.

    Those who were able to see the highly acclaimed biopic took to social media to share memorable lines from the film and even generated memes out of them.

    But which “Heneral Luna” quote is the most striking of them all? In an online poll conducted by INQUIRER.net, 29.39 percent of readers or equivalent to 1,892 out of 6,437 respondents said the quote that struck the most truthful note was “Negosyo o Kalayaan? Bayan o sarili, pumili ka! (Business or freedom? Our native land or one’s self-serving interests, choose one!)”

    The line was delivered by lead character General Antonio Luna, played by actor John Arcilla, during a meeting of then President Emilio Aguinaldo’s Cabinet in Bulacan.
    Luna was addressing Cabinet members who proposed the annexation of the Philippines to the United States amid fears that their private businesses would collapse in the war.
    Meanwhile, more than 18 percent of respondents or 1,169 readers chose the quote, “Kaya nating magbuwis ng buhay para sa pamilya pero para sa isang prinsipyong makabayan? (We can sacrifice our life for our family but how about for a common patriotic cause?”)
    Lamenting the Filipinos’ too much focus on filial interests over national consciousness, it was delivered also by Luna when he was talking to young journalist Joven Hernando, played by Aaron Villaflor.
    The quote “Ang taong may damdamin ay hindi alipin (A person who has emotion is not a slave)” garnered 17.24 percent of total votes or equivalent to 1,110 respondents, while the line “Wala ba tayong karapatang mabuhay nang malaya? (Don’t we have the right to live freely?)” secured 17.03 percent or 1,096 votes. Both were delivered by Luna.
    More than 18 percent of respondents or 1,170 readers said they have another quote in mind.
    The poll ran for a span of eight days, or from Sept. 22 to Sept. 30.

    In a similar poll conducted by Line which gathered 465 votes, respondents deemed the quote “Kaya nating magbuwis ng buhay para sa pamilya pero para sa isang prinsipyong makabayan?” as the most striking (116 votes), followed by “Negosyo o kalayaan? Bayan o sarili, pumili ka!” (114 votes); “Ang taong may damdamin ay hindi alipin,” (82 votes); and “Wala ba tayong karapatang mabuhay nang malaya?” (37 votes). A total of 116 respondents answered “none of the above.”
    Produced by Artikulo Uno Productions, “Heneral Luna” breached the P150-million mark in box office as of Wednesday despite initial fears that it would be pulled out early in cinemas to give way to foreign and more mainstream local films. TVJ

    Critic Harry Windsor reviewed Erik Matti’s “Honor Thy Father” in the United States trade publication The Hollywood Reporter. The Filipino movie—which stars John Lloyd Cruz, Meryll Soriano and Tirso Cruz III—is part of the 40th Toronto International Film Festival, ongoing in Canada until Sept. 20. Windsor describes Matti’s film as a “muscularly indignant thriller…a flinty portrait of inequality and vigilante justice in modern Philippines.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Elwood Perez’s “Esoterika: Maynila” will be shown at the Shang Cineplex of the Shangri-La Plaza, from Sept. 23 to 29. Last March, “Esoterika: Maynila” was featured at the 39th Hong Kong International Film Festival, where it was hailed as a “confrontational yet rewarding odyssey.” Last month, it was screened at the Cinemalaya. Chris Millado, Cinemalaya festival director, describes it as a “voyeuristic peek into the artsy ghettos of Manila and the whims of its rarefied inhabitants.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Dennis Trillo rules TV-film thespic scene
    
    
    TRILLO. Goes for the emotional jugular—but knows when to stop.
    Who’s the best actor this ongoing TV season? No, it’s not Alden Richards, famously mooning over his thus far unreachable and unattainable Yaya Dub. It’s Dennis Trillo in “My Faithful Husband.”
    Aside from being naturally sensitive and insightful, Dennis is helped in coming up with an exceptional performance in the new soap by the unusually emotional nature of the character he’s assigned to play—a young man who’s constantly failed in his lifelong quest for genuine, faithful love.
    Even as a child, Dennis’ character was scorned and rejected by his very own mother (Snooky Serna, in the most “hateful” portrayal of her career). When he was old enough to experience romantic love, his feelings were similarly played around with by women, and even his greatest love (Jennylyn Mercado) has turned out to be faithless and dallied with another man, breaking Dennis’ character’s heart.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Last Monday, for instance, Dennis cried buckets of tears in the hospital room where she was recovering from injuries sustained in a car crash also involving the other man in her life—and Dennis even entertained the dire thought of “medically” ending her faithless existence!

    Given such a sad, mad character to play, Dennis has had to come up with his best portrayal, thus his “award” this month, in our considered estimation.
    But, it isn’t just a matter of great opportunity and “space” for an actor to strut his thespic stuff—most other stars would have come up short, or played it excessively loud, superficially lachrymose and broad. For his part, Dennis is able to emotionally go for the jugular—but, after his thespic point has been made, he’s sufficiently judicious to leave well enough alone, and no longer belabors the deeply emotional scene at hand.
    Adding to the strong impression that Dennis is making this season is the fact that he’s also starring in the big film bio of INC founder, Felix Manalo. He can be expected to memorably do full justice to that plum thespic assignment as well, so the next big question is, what could he possibly come up with for a TV-film encore? We trust that the constantly improving and maturing actor will keep surprising us—again and again!
    Viewers’ rights
    At a recent media forum, we were asked to talk about viewers’ rights, and we did our best to encourage the members of the audience to react to the TV programs they watched, instead of just passively “accepting” whatever TV people throw their way.
    Let’s pretend, we said, that TV producers and directors can hear what you’re saying. What would you like to tell them about the shows they make? What are the programs you like watching the most, and why do you love them so much?
    A viewer shared that he liked watching medical shows like “The Doctors” and its local counterparts, because they kept him informed about the latest medical discoveries and procedures.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Another member of the audience appreciated the “lessons” she learned from watching “Maala-ala Mo Kaya,” but wondered how much “artistic license” was involved in “enhancing” its real-life stories for the TV screen. A fan of “Sabado-badoo” spoke up and said he liked it better than other comedy shows on the tube, due to its “light” comedic touch.
    The “I-Witness” documentaries got their share of appreciative attention and mention for “exposing” the nagging and unsolved problems that make poor people’s lives extremely difficult.
    Keeping tabs
    “The Insider” and “Extra” were watched on a regular basis by some members of the audience, who wondered why their local counterparts don’t come up to their level in keeping tabs on the show biz scene. A viewer liked watching “The Voice Kids” except for the fact that some of the “child” singers were “already too old,” and the celebrity judges and mentors sometimes stole the show from the young talents, who should be the main focus of the program.
    On cable TV, another viewer boosted “how-to” shows and programs that detail how simple gadgets or complex machines are made. A fan of news and public affairs programs noted that Rico Hizon is doing well on the BBC channel.
    For our part, we shared that another Filipino, David Ingles, is also doing good work covering the global financial scene, this time on the Bloomberg channel.
    Among the cable sitcoms cited were “Two and A Half Men” and “The Big Bang Theory.” And we again took advantage of the opportunity to plug some of our favorite TV shows like “Saturday Night Live,” “60 Minutes” and the programs of Mareng Winnie Monsod and Pia Hontiveros.
    ‘Sleep-in’ interview
    Thanks, by the way, to all of the readers who went out of their way to express their appreciation for our recent “sleep-in” interview-encounter with King and Boots Rodrigo. The Rodrigos themselves texted to share reactions they got from their friends about the “insightful” piece. We promised to write more such extended pieces in the future, should similarly interesting and “exclusive” subjects arise.
    And, yes, we’ll be coming up with another compilation of “Boob Tube Booboos”—next issue!
    On other topics, fans of Anthony Castelo are glad that their (still) favorite crooner is back in the public eye and mind, thanks to the recent musical tribute to him on “Asap.”
    Musical comeback
    They gush that he’s one of the best and handsomest male singers we’ve produced and hope that he’ll stage a musical comeback, because he still has what it takes to make love songs sound and feel “special.”
    Another fan later complimented the show for also featuring Hajji Alejandro’s songs. Other suggestions for “older” singing stars to feature include Rico J. Puno, Louie Heredia, Basil Valdez and Raymond Lauchengco.
    Finally, a fan of the comebacking JM de Guzman reminds us to catch the young star’s new teleserye, “All of Me,” which has just started telecasting.
    The afternoon soap casts the also comebacking Albert Martinez. Let’s hope that the story’s “paranormal portal” hook will be clearly depicted, so viewers can empathize with its melodramatics on an acceptably realistic level, as well.

    The Archivo 1984 Film Series will screen Elwood Perez’s erotic drama “Silip” (known in the international circuit as “Daughters of Eve”) on Sept. 12, 5 p.m. The film top-bills the queens of 1980s sexy movies Maria Isabel Lopez and Sarsi Emmanuelle, with Mark Joseph and Myra Manibog. “Silip” was written by Ricky Lee. The screening will be held at the Archivo 1984 Gallery, Warehouse 2, 2135 Chino Roces Ave. (formerly Pasong Tamo), near King’s Court.
    Perez is this year’s recipient of the Gintong Ani or lifetime achievement award given by the 22nd Filipino International Cine Festival (Facine), for his extensive filmography, which “generates both critical attention and mass audience support.” Last year’s Gintong Ani honoree was Raymond Red.

    <content>From ‘Everest’ to Depp, highlights of the Venice Film fest
    
    
    People take souvenir photos in front of the logo of the 72nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, at the Venice Lido, Monday, Aug. 31, 2015. The world’s oldest movie festival will open on Sept. 2 through Sept. 12. AP
    VENICE, Italy— It’s a sure sign that summer’s over and the awards season is around the corner — the feast of fall film festivals.
    The 72nd Venice Film Festival opens Wednesday, followed later in September by movie extravaganzas in Toronto and New York. As well as celebrating the best of global cinema, the festivals battle one another to snag the biggest stars and hottest awards prospects.
    Venice, the oldest and stateliest of the bunch, brings 11 days of red carpets, flashbulbs, parties and premieres to the canal-crossed Italian city. Here are five highlights, trends and themes to look out for:
    High-altitude opener
    Venice’s opening slot has developed a formidable hit-making reputation. In 2013, it sent the space saga “Gravity” into orbit and the film went on to win seven Academy Awards. Last year’s opener, the midlife crisis comedy “Birdman,” scooped up four Oscars, including one for Best Picture, and revived Michael Keaton’s career.

    This year’s festival opens with Baltasar Kormakur’s thriller “Everest,” which stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Robin Wright, Emily Watson and Jason Clarke in the fact-based story of peril on the world’s highest mountain. Producers’ hopes are as high as a Himalayan summit.

    Hollywood heavyweights
    Some of Hollywood’s biggest names will be walking the red carpet on Venice’s Lido island — and hoping it’s a rehearsal for Oscar night.
    Among potential prize contenders are Johnny Depp, all but unrecognizable as a Boston mobster in Scott Cooper’s “Black Mass;” Eddie Redmayne as a transgender woman in Tom Hooper’s “The Danish Girl;” and Idris Elba as an African warlord in Cary Fukunaga’s “Beasts of No Nation.”
    The combination of Tilda Swinton, Dakota Johnson and Ralph Fiennes could make waves in Luca Guadagnino’s drama “A Bigger Splash,” while Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult find love in a dangerous time in Drake Doremus’ futuristic feature “Equals.”
    And last year’s Venice hero, Keaten, returns alongside Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci in Tom McCarthy’s “Spotlight,” about Boston Globe journalists investigating sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.
    Global giants

    Venice is offering up meaty fare from heavyweight global auteurs among the 21 films that Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron and his jury will consider for the festival’s top prize, the Golden Lion.
    Israel’s Amos Gitai depicts the traumatic 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in “Rabin, The Last Day,” while Russia’s Aleksandr Sokurov — a previous Golden Lion winner — tells the story of the Louvre museum — and of Europe — in “Francofonia.”
    Italy’s Marco Bellocchio bites into the vampire-themed “Blood of My Blood.”
    Among the quirkier-sounding offerings are Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson’s animated feature “Anomalisa” and musician Laurie Anderson’s canine-themed feature debut “Heart of a Dog.”

    Real-life drama
    Tragic and transformative real-life events loom large in the festival’s strong slate of documentaries.
    Zhao Liang’s Golden Lion contender “Behemoth” shows giant mines gouging the Chinese steppe, while Evgeny Afineevsky’s “Winter On Fire” charts the mass demonstrations that toppled Ukraine’s government in 2014.
    Amy Berg’s “Janis” traces the short, sensational life of singer Janis Joplin, while aerial-photography master Yann Arthus-Bertrand celebrates humanity in the kaleidoscopic “Human,” which has premieres in Venice and at the United Nations in New York on Sept. 12.
    Cinema controversy
    No festival worth its salt would be complete without a soul-searching debate over the future of cinema. This year’s comes courtesy of streaming service Netflix, which is moving into fiction films with “Beasts of No Nation.”
    Netflix plans to release the African child-soldier drama simultaneously on-demand and in cinemas in October, a development that has alarmed distributors and movie theater owners.
    Venice director Alberto Barbera is unapologetic about including it. He says cinema is undergoing “seismic shifts” and film festivals have to reflect them. TVJ

    <content>MOVIE REVIEW: ‘Silong’ shelters a sickening secret
    
    
    “SILONG” or shelter may be a very comforting word for a film title but not before you discover the surprising secret behind its use.
    This seems to be the ultimate intention of singer-turned-director Jeffrey Hidalgo and writer-director Roy Sevilla Ho as they helmed together the appalling story of Miguel and Valarie, which premiered at Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival this year as the closing film.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    In the film, actor Piolo Pascual plays the role of Doctor Miguel Cascarro who bumps into Valerie as he drives one night on his way home.

    The mysterious woman, in the person of actress Rhian Ramos, was badly wounded, her body besmirched with blood.
    Her unexpected arrival was quite a perfect distraction for Miguel who still mourns the passing of his wife Caroline (Angel Jacob) and worries how to save his ancestral house from its creditor.
    But it turns out, the angelic face of Valerie doesn’t size up to Miguel’s lofty expectations.
    CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/Silong Movie
    Calm before the storm
    The film opens with Miguel’s cello wafting a soothing sound of music to the viewers’ ears. His home was established, giving an early peek to his solitary life, while showing a montage of Valerie, hobbling on her way amid the bushes and desperate for rescue.
    Then comes the scene wherein Gilbert (Guji Lorenzana) urges Miguel, his brother-in-law, to leave the house, move to the city and get on with his life.
    Silong’s undertaking of the story’s exposition is a lulling calm before the storm.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    It manages to make its audience hang loose along its laid-back beginning, with the promise of the imminent romantic connection between its main characters.
    Miguel welcoming a sexy visitor to his home, nursing her back to health and trusting her to the point of ravishing her on top of a dining table—all provide a good leverage so the film could execute its mighty ploy.
    The film is off for a clean start, putting much patience on the story’s pace, while slowly and surely taking advantage of the characters’ projected innocence and vulnerability, before its twists smack people in the gut with impaling force.
    Hidalgo and Ho laudably bank on Miguel and Valerie’s tangible chemistry to set forth veiled clues that later unspools itself to complete the narrative.
    CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/Silong Movie
    Cryptic personalities
    It would be apt to say that Piolo Pascual’s performance couldn’t be found wanting. His measured portrayal of a languid but composed doctor contributes much to his cryptic personality.
    The truth Miguel hides blends well to that of Valerie’s. It’s a classic bittersweet case where both keep a secret from each other for caution while giving in to their earthly desires.
    Rhian Ramos, likewise, has tellingly grown to become a versatile actress. She charms big time, not only on screen but on her delivery of the major scenes. She is quite effective in developing Valerie’s character, using all of her valuable assets to double cross Miguel—her eyes, her smiles, her voice, her body language.
    With the film’s slick buildup, from the moment Miguel takes care of Valerie until both get tangled in the maelstrom of surprises, the story no longer needs other players to accomplish its real point.
    The way Hidalgo and Ho handle the subtleties laced on Miguel and Valerie’s personas is enough to bring the film to a rip-roaring ascent down to its horrid conclusion.
    CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/Silong Movie
    Early warning
    “Silong” is definitely a refreshing take on Filipino romantic-thrillers that are not seen much on movie screens these days.
    It looks like Hidalgo and Ho succeed on breaking through the clutter and lodging themselves at a secure spot in the country’s movie industry.
    The revelations the film hold will not fail to send the viewers in utter shock at any point, with the help of its neat screenplay and cinematography.
    And so the next time you invite a stranger into your home, let “Silong” be your early warning.

    <content>Cinemalaya 2015: 10 short films endear and scare, too
    
    
    THE Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival kicked off last weekend at the Cultural Center of the Philippines with 10 short films endearing and even scaring indie buffs.
    Directed by the 21-year old Kenneth Dagatan, “Sanctissima” has become one of the early favorites under Shorts A category for its gory depiction of a lone abortionist who feeds the fetuses of her customers to her child.
    The film received a warm reception from members of the audience after it made them cringe in fright and disgust.

    “I didn’t expect the reaction of the crowd would be like that. It is only now that I confirmed that the film is really effective,” Dagatan told INQUIRER.net.

    Dagatan said he’s always wanted to make a horror film that isn’t clichéd and different from what typically seen on mainstream movies.
    “I’ve liked to capture the perspective of the protagonist. There is no jump scare, only creep and gore,” said Dagatan who is a fresh graduate of University of San Carlos.
    Ryanne Murcia, a college instructor at Ateneo de Zamboanga University, felt happy and humbled to be able to share his film “Apasol (Chasing Sun),” which tells the story of same sex lovers Mark and El spending their last afternoon together and wishing on a tree.
    “Apasol was inspired from a state of mind when something so wonderful is happening and you don’t want it to end,” said Murcia.
    He added that his short film reveals the demure side of a gay relationship that not all people see. “The silent, poetic and tender side.”

    Childhood memories
    Cinemalaya multi-awardee Rommel “Milo” Tolentino, known for his works that revolve around children and family, returned again this year with another humorous piece “Nenok” which depicts a nine-year-old street kid in Malolos, Bulacan finding a home in the premises of Barasoain Church with the company of a groundskeeper.

    “Nenok embraces the memories of my childhood spent in the hallowed halls of the Cathedral of Lipa in Batangas and my juvenile fascination with the concrete saints that tower its corridors,” Tolentino shared.
    “Like my protagonist child, my films are light-hearted and sunny, sprinkled with enough sugar and wit and brimming with heart,” he said.
    When asked whether he would always pursue child-centered themes, Tolentino said, “At the moment my brain is wired to stories about children but it doesn’t mean that’s all I want to do. But I don’t mind exploring it further because these kinds of stories or films make me happy and brightly optimistic.”
    The other two shorts under Shorts A are: “Gatilyo ng Baril”, directed by Eero Yves Francisco and Glenmark C. Doromal, which revisits the assassination attempt on former first lady Imelda Marcos; and “Kyel” by Arvin Belarmino that delves on drug addiction.

    Love and loss
    The Shorts B category, meanwhile, treated the audience to different shades of love and loss.
    Inspired by Palanca awardee Conchitina Cruz’ poem, “Lisyun qng Geografia (Geography Lessons)” earned a good deal of attention for its themes of friendship, regret and loss.
    The film, directed by 23-year-old Petersen Vargas, is about a man named Tib who is leaving the province of Pampanga for good until one day he sees the map that his close buddy Tric made for him during their high school days. Tib then decides to go back to all the places that are special to him and his bestfriend.
    “The story is very personal to me. You could say it’s autobiographical. It was inspired by an experience I had in high school,” Vargas said.
    “I really want to make films that really expose the beauty of Pampanga. And so I used Kapampangan language all throughout the film,” he added.
    “Lisyun qng Geografia” is Vargas’ undergraduate thesis at UP Film Institute. It already made rounds in several film festivals in and out of the country including Cinema One Originals, Singkuwento, CineKabalen, Cinemanila, Thai and Mumbai Shorts Film Festival.
    Stage and film actress Mailes Kanapi said she completely identifies with her character Cinta, a middle-aged and has-been actress who relives her stardom by watching her ‘70s movies and one day falls in love with a rock as told by Martika Escobar’s “Pusong Bato (Stone Heart).”
    “I think the rock is not a symbol. It’s real. She really fell in love with a rock. I know it’s weird…it’s really transcendental thing for me…this is the truest role I’ve done,” Kanapi said.
    Escobar disclosed the concept for her film was born out of curiosity for she never got involved in any romantic human relationship.
    “I thought what if I fall in love with an object? From there, I researched and found out there are really people who develop feelings with inanimate things,” Escobar said in Filipino.

    Puppet
    Another interesting short is Darwin Novicio’s “Papitir” which relates a ventriloquist looking back on his gloomy past during a performance in children’s party.
    Novicio said he chose a ventriloquist as his character because it could play two personalities at the same time, the puppet and himself. “He is able to convey his thoughts and talk to himself, though in a different way with the help of the puppet.”
    “I drew the story from the experience of my actor (Ruther Urquia). At one point, he had to mourn for the death of his father and at the same time he needed to perform in four kiddy parties,” he said.
    Meanwhile, Annemikami Pablo’s “Mater” touched a rather sensitive subject when she presents the story of a mother and her daughter and the deterioration of their relationship because of religion.
    The melancholic atmosphere of “Wawa” also impressed the crowd as the film takes them on a journey of a young boy and how he lays his deceased father to his final resting place.
    The festival runs until August 15 at CCP and Greenbelt 3 Cinema.

    (UPDATE) The good news that have been circulating on social media and coffee shops in the past few weeks in this year’s Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival revolved on three highlights.
    One is the focus on short films, which in the previous years have been put unceremoniously in the sidelights. Second is the inclusion of a new section called Asian indies. Third is for those who missed watching the previous winning films, this is the time to savor them all.

    With these three, those who’ve been saying that this year’s lineup has become unexciting may have been misinformed by naysayers who’ve been wishing every year that it could be Cinemalaya’s last and final year.

    Because there have been talks that the 11th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival has a boring lineup due to the postponement of the full-length categories in competition, namely the New Breed and Directors’ Showcase.
    The New Breed covers the entries of neophyte filmmakers while the Directors’ Showcase caters to the veterans.
    For this year, only the short film category is in competition.
    Without the main posts
    The talks went on to explore that since former Cinemalaya Foundation chairman and the festival’s longtime benefactor, Antonio “Tony Boy” Cojuangco had withdrawn his financial support as early as 2014, the fate of Cinemalaya has become uncertain. Cojuangco was reportedly spending an average of P10 million a year for the festival.

    But the 10th year of Cinemalaya was a success despite the issue.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Then came one of its pioneering prime-movers and long-time president Nestro Jardin following Cojuangco’s departure. After organizing the 10th year of the festival, Jardin announced he’s moving on to another project in 2015.
    READ: Nes Jardin leaves Cinemalaya
    There were talks that since the 10th year had been dubbed “Cinemalaya X,” though with good intentions, the entire festival has been literally crossed out or “exed”. Nada, gone kaput, zilch, the whole festival down the drain. The legacy would just be passed on to the new ones like Sinag Maynila, Sineng Pambansa, CinemaRehiyon, the Quezon City International Film Festival and a lot more that were either inspired or influenced by Cojuangco and Nardin’s baby.
    Whatever happens, its report card in entirety has just been very exemplary. To date, Cinemalaya has produced 118 full feature independent films and 96 short films, many of which have won awards in other local competitions and international festivals.
    In total, the 10-year-old Cinemalaya has showcased more than 1,000 works by independent filmmakers which cover full feature films, shorts, documentaries, Filipino film classics and art films.
    No doubt, Cinemalaya’s roll-call of alumni comprised the best of the best of our young filmmakers, or the future of Philippine cinema.
    Directors of commercial films who have grown tired of the mainstream setup embraced Cinemalaya to create–in the words of Joel Lamangan–their “dream project away from the clutches of commercialism.”
    On the other side of the pole, at a time when no art-house cinemas dared touch the epic films of Lav Diaz, Cinemalaya showed them either as opening or closing film, if not part of the exhibition.
    So without Cojuangco and Jardin, Cinemalaya has been predicted by some sectors to crumble, like a house losing two main posts. Who will fund the 11th year? Who will organize? Is the Cultural Center of the Philippines, its official home and partner for 10 years, going to shoulder everything?
    In January this year, our source at the CCP who requested anonymity for privacy reasons said the Department of Budget and Management agreed to fund the 11th year, but only with its short film category in competition and the feature-length scheduled in 2016.
    Obviously with only the shorts in 2015 and the full length in 2016, Cinemalaya Foundation is short of funds.
    Despite that, cheers and congratulations in the indie circuit overflowed. Not too long though as the festival had its share of controversy even before it started, just like in the previous years.
    When the new heads of the festival announced a couple of months ago that it will combine the New Breed and Directors’ Showcase entries in a single competition, the decision was met with protests from various sectors.
    The most vocal was Kidlat Tahimik (filmmaker Eric de Guia), who has been part of the 10-year-old festival either as chairman or member of the jury.
    Tahimik reasoned out that if it were like boxing, it’s like mixing the neophytes with the heavyweight or “like high school boxers being sent to tussle with Manny Pacquiao.”

    Film showing must go on
    Then again, our source said nothing is final and who knows, with a new administration coming in, the fate of Cinemalaya 12 is still uncertain. “Let’s just be positive about it. Let’s hope the next President will support it,” our source said.
    For now, the show must go on and it will start Friday with Director Brillante Mendoza’s “Taklub,” which topbills Nora Aunor.

    This year, Cinemalaya’s main man is Chris Millado, who is also CCP’s artistic director and vice president. Just like in the previous years, also calling the shots in the selection process is filmmaker Laurice Guillen.
    Millado and Guillen have been part of Cinemalaya’s organizing committee from day one. Millado has taken the task of being festival director since 2013.
    Besides the new shorts, it will also show the best of the best of the previous winners in the full-length categories.
    If you missed previous award-winning titles like “Donor,” “Halaw,” “Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Olivers,” “Posas,” “Bisperas,” “Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe,” “Bwaya,” “Kamera Obscura,” “Tulad ng Dati,” “Kasal,” “Magkakabaung,” “Last Supper No. 3,” “Esprit de Corps,” “Imbisibol,” “Diablo,” “Tribu,” “Engkwentro” and “Endo,” among others, this is the best time to troop to the CCP.
    Among the new ones making their Cinemalaya debut, based on social media accounts the early favorites are Pepe Diokno’s “Above The Clouds,” which has Pinoy rock icon Pepe Smith as one of the leads, and the Piolo Pascual-Rhian Ramos topbilled suspense thriller “Silong”, directed by Jeffrey Hidalgo and Roy Sevilla-Ho.
    Award-winning Asian indies
    The organizers would like to highlight the foreign films under a new section called “The Independents: Asian Showcase”.
    
    Zhang Yimou’s acclaimed “Coming Home” (China/2014) with Chinese superstar Gong Li in the lead role will open the Asian showcase on August 8, at 9 p.m. at the CCP Main Theater.
    
    Set in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, “Coming Home” depicts a woman’s struggle to regain her memory and reconnect with her long-imprisoned husband.
    The Asian indie film section will offer award winning films of Netpac (Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema) such as “Poet on a Business Trip” by Ju Anqi, “The Monk” by The Maw Naing, “Six Feet High” by Sanal Kumar Sashidaran, “Summer Kyoto” by Hiroshi Toda, “The Night of Silence” by Reis Celik, “The Move” by Marat Saruklu, “The Owners” by Adikhana Yerzhanov and “The Ferry” by Shi Wei. Other prizewinning Asian indie films to be shown are “The Tale of Princess Kaguya” by Isao Takahata and “The Last Reel” by Sotho Kulikar.
    
    “Poet On A Business Trip” by Ju Anqi (China, 2014) is a documentary shot more than 10 years ago. In this film, a poet sets off on a ‘business trip’ through inhospitable Xinjiang province. The physically exhausting trip provides an existential brothel visit, bumping on bad roads, and a glimpse of a disappearing world.
    “Poet on a Business Trip” won the Netpac Award for the best Asian film at the International Rotterdam Festival 2015.
    
    “The Monk” by The Maw Naing (Myanmar/Czech Republic/ 2014) is a sensitive coming-of-age tale that revolves around a young monk, Zawana, who had spent most of his life in a monastery in the Burmese countryside.

    Superstar and multi-awarded actress Nora Aunor stars in three films showing at the 11th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival and Competition on August 7-15, 2015 at the Cultural Center of the Philippines and Greenbelt 3. These are “Taklub,” “Dementia” and “Kinabukasan.”
    The award winning “Taklub” by Brillante Mendoza will open Cinemalaya on August 7, 7pm at the CCP Main Theater. “Taklub” is a story of three major characters–Bebeth, Larry and Erwin, whose lives intertwine after the Super Typhoon Haiyan (local name “Yolanda”) ravaged the city of Tacloban–leaving survivors to search for their dead, while keeping their sanity intact, and protecting what little faith there may be.
    Aunor plays Bebeth who searches for the remains of her three children in the hope that any identified records could match a DNA test from those buried at the mass grave.

    The much-acclaimed “Dementia” by Perci Intalan has Aunor playing the role of a woman dealing with early onset of dementia. But is it really dementia or is there something really haunting her? Jasmine Curtis Smith, Yul Servo, Bing Loyzaga, Chynna Ortaleza and Althea Vega appear with Aunor in this film that won awards and nominations at both local and foreign film festivals.
    “Dementia” will be shown on August 11, 6:15 p.m. at the CCP Little Theater.
    Aunor plays an older woman moving on from a painful loss in the short film “Kinabukasan (The Day After)” by Adolfo Alix. A link from the past appears—a young man who has questions that she must help him find answers for.
    Rosanna Roces and Alden Richards co-star in this film. “Kinabukasan” will be screened on August 8, 3:30 pm at the CCP Little Theater.

    If there is one thing Filipino-Italian director and actor Ruben Maria Soriquez like about Filipino actors, it would be their unbelievable dedication to their craft.
    “They are more passionate. It is less about money when they act in movies. It’s more about if they like really the script, the subject,” Soriquez told INQUIRER.net on Thursday in an exclusive interview. “And they don’t look at their watch, like in Italy they do.”
    Soriquez directed “Of Sinners and Saints”, an entry to this year’s second edition of the World Premieres Film Festival in Manila under the New Filipino Cinema section.

    The film won best actor for Soriquez as well as best production design. It also stars Raymond Bagatsing, Chanel Latorre, Polo Ravales, Althea Vega, Richard Quan and Sue Prado.

    “It is my first time to work with them. I enjoyed it. I wish I can work with them again,” he said. “They don’t sigh if [I] ask for extra time.”
    “In Italy they are more strict because there are unions. After 6pm, its already over time. Actors would work eight hours but not more than 10 hours,” he said.
    Soriquez observed Filipino actors could work for more than 16 hours and would not complain.
    “I worked with mainstream actor’s in Italy. This is their difference. They are more demanding,” he said.
    Before settling in the Philippines for good in 2013, with his Filipina wife and son, the 43-year-0ld Soriquez had worked in Italy as an actor and director.
    His works, though independently produced but had commercial run, are two mafia movies “The Fall of Redemption” and “The Broken Crown”. His documentary feature, “Sexocracy: The Man of Bunga Bunga”, tells about the sex scandal involving the former Italian Prime Minister.
    He also used to direct documentaries, mostly about nature, for World Wildlife Fund.

    First acting award
    Born and raised in Bologna to Filipino father and Italian mother, Soriquez graduated in University of Bologna with a degree in Human Resources.
    In 1992, he started his career in theater acting. He obtained a diploma in acting at Colli Theatre School in 2008 and since then appeared in TV commercials and plays.
    He took a filmmaking course organized by New York Film Academy in Florence in 2007 and also studied scriptwriting and editing in New York.
    In “Of Sinners and Saints”, the fourth film he directed, Soriquez played the lead role as an Italian priest from Rome who is assigned to a parish in Payatas and meets again the woman he used to love when he was still a seminarian. He decides to help the woman, whose six-year-old child is missing.
    The best actor award he received was his first and he couldn’t believe it happened in the Philippines.
    “It felt great. I wasn’t really shocked but I was surprised. I know I did a good job. But the role was not easy. A lot of emotion and physicality involved. There are also fight scenes,” he said.
    “I didn’t have time to really prepare for the role. I was so busy. I produced, directed and co-wrote it,” he added.
    But it looked he really did have nothing to worry about. Because of the kind of training he had, he could definitely deliver.
    Soriquez said he learned a lot from his teachers from Actors’ Studio of New York. He had workshops with internationally acclaimed directors like the British Alan Parker and Italian Giuseppe Tornatore.
    He was also taught of the Stanislavski’s system of acting, the same technique practiced by Hollywood actors such as Robert de Niro, Al Pacino and Nicolas Cage. “That’s my method. It is very deep,” he said.

    Controversial story
    Soriquez conceived the story of “Of Sinners and Saints” together with his co- writer Bong Ramos.
    “The inspiration is to talk about something really controversial and to put on the spotlight some problems here in the Philippines like child abuse, violence against women and poverty,” he said. “I want to talk about some social issues.”
    He said the film would appeal so much to the Filipino audience because of its controversial story, good performances of the actors and nice cinematography.
    “[They will learn that] from sacrifice comes hope. That’s why at the end of the film, there was as sacrifice. But it would let somebody else to survive.”
    Wishing to create more movies in the country both for festivals and commercial run, he said he desires to act in Tagalog and also be an actor of other directors.
    “I really love acting,” he said. “I want to act in every movie I’ll make. But not always as the lead actor. If the story requires a Filipino lead, why not?”
    Asked whether he was to choose between directing and acting, he said: “If I want to be less stressed I choose acting, because directing is stressful.”
    Soriquez is currently preparing his next film to be shot in the province of Isabela using the local language Itawis.

    <content>‘Unfriend’ on HBO Max Latin America
    
    
    Joselito “Jay” Altarejos’ “Unfriend” will be screened on HBO Max Channel in Latin America this month. “Unfriend,” which is based on a true-life tragedy involving the death of young gay lovers, premieres tomorrow, with repeats on June 12, 17, 25,   28 and July 1.
    The movie, which stars Sandino Martin and Angelo Ilagan, made its debut in the Panorama section of the Berlin International Film Festival last year, where it received good reviews from critics who called it “notable” and “a well-composed study of an unraveling soul after the loss of love.”  Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Nora Aunor delivers another indelible portrayal in Cannes-winning drama
    
    
    NORA Aunor feels it’s important for the world to know what happened in Tacloban. TROY ESPIRITU
    Is faith or religious patronage earned? The recurring question hovers over “Taklub (Trap),” Brillante Mendoza’s Cannes-winning drama about Yolanda survivors, starring Nora Aunor, as it trots out true-to-life tales of anguish, desolation, acceptance and slow reconstruction one year after the super typhoon struck Tacloban—and left more than 6,200 people dead in its wake!
    The devastation leaves gaping holes in survivors’ lives: The nightmares that hound fisherman Renato (Lou Veloso, in fine dramatic form) continue to unravel when he loses more members of his family to a fire accident in Tent City, where he and 2,500 other homeless survivors have been living in deplorable conditions since 2013.
    As he struggles to make some sense of his life’s tattered remains, Renato discloses his wish to be swallowed by the sea that feeds him.

    Even more telling is the story of Larry (the memorably stirring Julio Diaz), a devout Catholic who walks away from the cross he carries during a religious procession when he finds it too heavy. —Get it?

    Recalling Mendoza’s “Kaleldo” heyday, these subtle shades of metaphor and religious symbolism aren’t treated with a heavy hand, and allow the film to eschew schmaltzy melodrama for something more thoughtful and provocative.
    The stories of Renato and Larry may seem random, but the thespically resplendent Nora Aunor, who comes off with the finest portrayal we’ve seen so far this year, strings them all together with indelible reactions devoid of the overwrought theatricality of her characterization in Joel Lamangan’s “Hustisya” or the contrived excesses of Perci Intalan’s overrated “Dementia.”
    As Aunor’s Mater Dolorosa character, Leonora Lariosa aka Bebeth, aptly muses, each victim has his/her own burden to bear—as does she, who tirelessly walks the rough roads and ruins of San Jose, one of Tacloban’s 138 barangays, to help those who can’t help themselves. Bebeth bottles up her grief as she mulls over her missing kids and broken marriage.
    “Taklub” faces its grim subject matter head on, but treats its characters, a reflection of the Filipino people’s resilience, with the dignity they deserve: You won’t see its judicious actors succumbing to ululations of overwhelming grief—which is a feat in itself!
    It’s hard to think about tragedy/poverty “porn” when you watch how Aunor eloquently limns her indelible performance and enables the film to transcend the inherent bleakness of its themes.
    Hers is as poignant and fragile a portrayal as we’re ever likely to see about coming to terms with the horrifying devastation wrought by Yolanda—and a master class in restraint and thespic grace!
    There’s a perception that the Superstar’s prodigious acting chops may have been underutilized here—and, while we agree that she could have been used in more sequences, we also think that histrionic displays of her dramatic brilliance would undermine the movie’s understated allure, and serve Nora more than the film itself.

    Yes, those soulful orbs work their wonders, as they always do—but, so does the rest of the legendary actress’ body: In one acutely staged death scene, Bebeth refuses to see more of Renato’s grief and despair.
    As she walks out of the hospital (with Nora’s back facing the camera), we notice Bebeth’s weary shoulders slump in resignation as she silently wipes her tears away. —So, who needs more screen time?

    After the Tokyo fest last year, Khavn de la Cruz’s “Ruined Heart: Another Love Story Between a Criminal and a Whore” had its American premiere as the opening movie of the 22nd Chicago Underground Film Festival on May 13. The fest described the Filipino film as a “gangster odyssey of color and grit… a punk noir opera… that boasts a killer soundtrack that constantly shifts the shape of the story while playing upon an age-old narrative.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Brillante Mendoza: You can never go wrong with real stories
    
    
    Director Brillante Mendoza and writer Honelyn Joy Alipio holds up Taklub’s citation award from Cannes Film Festival. ARVIN MENDOZA
    “You can never go wrong with real stories, stories that are coming from the heart, coming from the survivors.”
    This was what award-winning director Brillante Mendoza spoke of “Taklub (Trap),” his latest masterpiece that tells the stories of survivors of the strongest typhoon on record to hit the Philippines in November 2013.
    Super typhoon Yolanda devastated much of the Visayas region, particularly the Samar and Leyte provinces. It marked a death toll of more than 6,300, according the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

    “We, being resilient in the midst of everything, especially when they (survivors) are trying to pick up the pieces and go on living…that’s the character you don’t see with other races,” he told INQUIRER.net on Monday during the first Philippine screening of the movie at SM Aura Premiere in Taguig City.
    “Perhaps we have been accustomed to [tragedies] and we have no choice but to move on. We just laugh and accept [them] because we have no time to grieve,” he said.
    “At the same time it’s painful because as humans we should have time to grieve because of our loss. But we just accept it as part of our life and we become stonger,” he added.
    A docu about climate change
    ‘Taklub’ won the Ecumenical Jury Prize-Special Mention at the Cannes Film Festival last month.
    According to the citation, the film was commended by the ecumenical jury “for the sensitive portrayal of individuals and communities working for life in the midst of suffering and death in the shadows of natural catastrophes in the Philippines.”
    Superstar Nora Aunor headlines the engaging drama as a mother named Bebeth who lost her children during the onslaught of the typhoon. Also part of the cast were Julio Diaz (as Larry), Lou Veloso (as Renato), Aaron Rivera (as Erwin), Romalito Mallari (as Marlon), Soliman Cruz (as Angel), Ruby Ruiz (as Kagawad Duke), Glenda Kennedy and John Rendez.

    ‘Taklub’ was produced by Mendoza’s Centerstage Productions and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in partnership with the Presidential Communications Operations Office-Philippines Information Agency through the endorsement of Senator Loren Legarda. The screenplay was helmed by Honelyn Joy Alipio.
    It was initially meant to be a documentary about climate change, but Mendoza said he asked Sen. Loren Legarda if he could make it a feature film. “So it would be accessible to the audience since the advocacy is climate change, so they would understand more its significance.”
    “The advocacy becomes part of the story that it doesn’t come off as propaganda. I think that is the best way to advocate an issue. You just tell the real story and it will be welcomed and understood by the people,” Mendoza said.
    What is the film’s ultimate message?
    Mendoza said: “As a viewer who has feelings and heart, when you see the film, I hope you would do something, as much for the other people as for yourself. It’s because the change begins with you.”
    “Taklub” premiered at the French film festival in Manila on Wednesday, along with Eric Lartigau’s “La Famille Bélier.”
    Mendoza was the first Filipino to win Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for his movie “Kinatay” (Butchered: The Execution of P) in 2009.

    Few trophies in movies are more sought after than the Palme d’Or, but, unlike the Academy Awards, which whittles its field down to a few favorites over the course of months, Cannes winners are chosen clandestinely by a jury.

    The mystery adds much suspense.
    Throughout the festival, the jury, led by Joel and Ethan Coen, has quietly slipped in and out of theaters. Their deliberations are private, but that doesn’t stop the world’s media from endlessly debating the possible preferences of the Coens and fellow jurors Guillermo del Toro, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sienna Miller, Sophie Marceau, Xavier Dolan, Rokia Traore and Rossy de Palma.
    The Cannes competition concluded Saturday with the stylish bloodbath of director Justin Kurzel’s “Macbeth,” starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.
    All of the 19 films in competition could feasibly walk away with the Palme d’Or, but a handful of perceived favorites have emerged.
    One thing is for certain: For the first time in several years, the Palme d’Or winner won’t be a three-hour art-house epic. In 2013, Steven Spielberg’s jury chose the lesbian coming-of-age drama “Blue is the Warmest Color”; last year, Jane Campion’s jury elected the glacial Turkish drama “Winter Sleep.”
    Here are four films that could land the Palme d’Or:
    ___

    “SON OF SAUL”
    First-time filmmakers rarely make it into the competition, let alone win the Palme d’Or. The Camera d’Or, the Cannes award for best first feature, could ultimately be what director Laszlo Nemes’ “Son of Saul” takes home, but no other film here found the universal acclaim that this Hungarian Holocaust drama did. Hauntingly gripping, it tracks a member of the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz who believes his son is among the gas chamber dead.
    ___
    “YOUTH”
    Italian director Paolo Sorrentino’s latest was considered a slight step below his previous, Oscar-winning film “The Great Beauty.” But his comic, melancholy tale of a retired composer (Michael Caine) reflecting on life and art at a Swiss spa was one of the liveliest entries of the festival. “Youth” is highlighted by the performances of two old vets: Caine and Harvey Keitel.
    ___
    “THE ASSASSIN”
    Director Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s latest was unquestionably the most beautiful film in Cannes, but was it the best? Many thought so, lavishing praise on the Taiwan director’s lush, painterly imagery and his quiet inversion of the martial arts genre. The 68-year-old Hou is widely regarded as one of today’s great filmmakers, but Western audiences’ awareness of him has lagged behind that of the critics. A Palme d’Or would be the crowning of an acknowledged master.
    ___
    “CAROL”
    Todd Haynes’ adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel landed with obvious resonance. This year’s Cannes has been dominated by debate about gender equality in film, and Haynes’ film, which stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as illicit lovers in ’50s America, is precisely the kind of story that has struggled to find big-screen representation. Plus, the tender precision of its romance had Cannes critics swooning.

    Apart from Paul Soriano’s “Kid Kulafu,” two more Filipino films will be shown at the Seattle International Film Festival, ongoing until June 7. Enzo Williams’ “Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo” will be screened on May 25, 27 and 29; while Carlos Siguion-Reyna’s “Hari ng Tondo,” on May 23 and 27. The fest’s website described “Bonifacio” as “stirringly dramatic … sweeping,” while “Hari” as a “crowd-pleasing bittersweet comedy.”  Bayani San Diego Jr.

Cabrido told the Inquirer that the victory was “unexpected.” “I am so happy, grateful and a bit shocked. Honestly, I didn’t think we had a chance because the other films were good.” He dedicates the honor to the film’s cast and crew. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    GROBAN. Reconnects with his musical-theater roots.
    Josh Groban was only in seventh grade when he performed in public for the first time, singing Gershwin’s enduring 1927 show tune, “‘S Wonderful” (from “Funny Face” and “An American in Paris”), for his school’s cabaret night.
    Armed with stadium-ready pipes, he wanted to pursue a career in musical theater, but ended up blazing the trail in “popera” and crossover music, instead.
    After his significant participation in 2008’s concert staging of “Chess,” the 34-year-old operatic-pop luminary comes full circle in his latest album, “Stages,” where he covers some of musical theater’s most memorable songs, like “Over The Rainbow” (from “Wizard of Oz”), “You’ll Never Walk Alone” (“Carousel”) and the stirring “Anthem” (from “Chess”).

    So, if you’re partial to show tunes and exceptional singing—quick, make a beeline for Groban’s sensational seventh studio album, his first No. 1 album in the United Kingdom, which allows him to reconnect with his musical-theater roots.

    His honey-coated vocals and lyrical singing don’t always guarantee success (“Try to Remember” is more schmaltzy than substantial) but, for the most part, they do the trick.
    The collection immortalizes the singer’s smashing renditions of the dreamy “Pure Imagination,” the breathtaking “If I Loved You” (with Audra McDonald, ravishing in her dramatic trills), and “Empty Chairs and Empty Tables,” made more haunting by the elegiac flourishes in its arrangement!
    A curious collaboration has Groban singing “All I Ask of You” with country star and American Idol Kelly Clarkson, who happily steps out of her comfort zone—and winkingly demonstrates her enviable stratospheric range!
    For those weaned on his foreign-language singles, the balladeer covers familiar ground in “Le Temps des Cathedrales” (from the French-Québécois  musical, “Notre-Dame de Paris”).
    Groban delivers his biggest “wow” moments in Stephen Sondheim’s melodically knotty but ingeniously crafted “Finishing the Hat,” the rabble-rousing wrap-up to “What I Did for Love,” his seamless natural voice-to-falsetto shifts in “Bring Him Home,” and his effusively emotive fusion of “Children Will Listen” and “Not While I’m Around.” —Talk about musically delectable treats, “Stages” is one of the season’s best bets!

    MANILA, Philippines–A digitally restored version of Lino Brocka’s 1976 film “Insiang” will be shown in this year’s Cannes International Film Festival, under the Cannes Classics section.
    “Insiang,” which top-bills Hilda Koronel and Mona Lisa, was first shown in Cannes in 1978, under the Section Parallèll/Directors’ Fortnight section.
    According to the fest’s website, “Insiang” bears the distinction of being “the first Filipino feature film to be presented at Cannes.”

    “Insiang” was restored through the efforts of The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project, L’Immagine Ritrovata and the Film Development Council of the Philippines.
    In 2013, Brocka’s “Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag” was also restored by the same organizations and presented in the Cannes Classics section.
    This year, “Insiang” will be screened alongside films by Costas Gavras (“Z”), Luis Puenzo (“La Historia Oficial”), along with an Orson Welles centennial presentation (“Citizen Kane,” “The Lady from Shanghai”).
    Another Filipino film, Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Taklub,” will likewise be shown in this year’s Cannes, in the Un Certain Regard section.
    The Cannes International Film Festival will be held in south of France, from May 13 to 24.

    Houston, we have no problem at all. The Philippines brought home six awards from the recently concluded 48th WorldFest Houston (Texas) International Film Festival on Saturday.
    Jeffrey Jeturian’s “Ekstra” won the festival’s highest accolade, grand winner for best foreign feature film, plus a Platinum in the comedy section.
    It was a record haul for the country. Louie Ignacio’s “Asintado” won a Gold Remi in the family/children’s category and a best rising star award for teen actor Jake Vargas; Perci Intalan’s “Dementia” also won a Gold Remi in the horror/fantasy section; Joel Lamangan’s “Kamkam” got yet another Gold Remi in the mature/adult themes category.

    Ignacio, who attended the awarding rites with Jeturian, informed the Inquirer via SMS, “There were 4,500 entries (in various genres and categories for TV and film) from around the world.” The festival is one of the oldest in the United States, along with Chicago and San Francisco.

    “I cried when we won Gold,” Ignacio said. “I am happy to share this honor with the industry. The audience applauded and cheered every time the Philippines won.”
    Ignacio is just as proud of his lead actor, a first-time winner. “I have always believed in Jake. It’s his first acting award and he won abroad.”
    JAKE VARGAS in “Asintado”
    Vargas, who is in Manila, told the Inquirer: “I didn’t expect to win. I am thankful to all those who have supported me from the start, especially Direk Louie.”
    Intalan, who didn’t make it to the Houston program, either, could not believe the “unexpected” triumph. “It’s our first international award. I am so glad that the entire team’s hard work was recognized. For a first-time filmmaker like myself, this is encouraging and inspiring.”
    Lamangan, who was in Manila as well, echoed those sentiments: “This is an honor for the local film industry and the country—especially coming from an august body that has lauded other Filipino films in the past.”
    Jeturian previously won Gold twice in Houston: 1999’s “Pila Balde” in the drama category and 2001’s “Tuhog” in the adult themes section.
    Jeturian told the Inquirer he felt “overwhelmed” because “Ekstra” had just won a Bronze at the New York Festival’s World’s Best TV and Films last week.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    He considers these accolades “an affirmation that mainstream and indie, entertainment and substance, can mix wonderfully and meaningfully.”
    “Ekstra” features “commercial” stars Vilma Santos, who was nominated for best actress, and Marian Rivera, who got a nod for best supporting actress. “They love Vilma in Houston,” the filmmaker said.
    That “Ekstra” clinched the top prize came as a huge surprise for Jeturian, too.
    “It was the last award to be announced. I never thought we were in the running,” recalled the director who was an honoree in the first Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards in 2010. “Everyone in the audience must have wondered, ‘Where did that film come from?’ It is such a small movie and for it to be noticed and recognized in a field of 500 feature films was stunning!”
    ‘Kinabukasan’ competes in Torino
    Apart from Joselito Altarejos’ feature film “Kasal” in the main section, Adolfo Alix Jr.’s “Kinabukasan (The Day After)” will compete in the short film category of the 30th Torino (Italy) Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, April 29-May 4. The short film is about a young man (Alden Richards) who meets the lover (Nora Aunor) of his late mother (Rosanna Roces). Alix and Aunor are honorees in previous editions of the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards.
     
    La Salle award for Aunor
    After receiving citations from the University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Naga and other institutions, Nora Aunor will be given the Gawad Lasallian sa Filipino from the Filipino Department of De La Salle University in Manila on April 27.
    Aunor is being honored for vital contributions in developing and popularizing art through her movies, songs and TV programs. Aunor was an honoree in two editions of the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards.

    Joselito “Jay” Altarejos’ “Kasal” will be competing at the 30th Torino (Italy) Gay and Lesbian Film Festival on April 29 to May 4. The fest’s website described the Cinemalaya winner as “almost an anthropological study about couples, marriage and family ties.” Altarejos’ previous films “Ang Lihim ni Antonio” (2009) and “Ang Laro sa Buhay ni Juan” (2010) were featured in the Torino fest’s panorama section.

    The Harvard Film Archive website described Diaz as “a filmmaker with a mission: against the oppression of the Filipino people and the inanities of commercial cinema.”

    The site compared Diaz, “with his twinned desires to bear witness to Filipino lives and to demand a better future,” to the late National Artist Lino Brocka, whose works were “eloquent about the joys and indignant about the sorrows of life in the Philippines.”

    Kidlat Tahimik at the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 2012, receiving another award, the Fukuoka Prize for Asian arts and culture photo: RICHARD A. REYES
    BAGUIO CITY—The acknowledged father of alternative/independent Filipino filmmaking returned the lifetime achievement award he received from the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival to protest its decision to do away with a program dedicated to young filmmakers.
    Dismayed by reports that Cinemalaya has taken out its New Breed film program, which provided eligible aspiring directors with seed money, Kidlat Tahimik returned his Gawad Balanghai trophy “for outstanding contribution to Philippine independent cinema” to the University of the Philippines Film Center on March 23, when he hosted the premiere of his film, “Balikbayan #1.”

    “Balikbayan #1” won the Caligari Prize in the 65th Berlin International Film Festival last February, over 40 years since his “Mababangong Bangungot (Perfumed Nightmare)” won the fest’s Fipresci Prize.

    “The New Breed program inspired young artists to find their inner duwende (his favorite reference to ‘unbridled creativity’),” Kidlat told the Inquirer.
    “New talents will be forced into the same boxing ring as the heavyweights,” he said, explaining his reaction to Cinemalaya merging the New Breed program with the section dedicated to established directors.
    “It’s like high school boxers being sent to tussle with Manny Pacquiao,” he said.
    He’s not withdrawing the bamboo camera that he gave Cinemalaya on its 10th anniversary. “I give them credit for inspiring young independent directors in the last 10 years. It’s the next 10 years I am worried about,” he said.
    Kidlat distributes bamboo cameras to individuals, groups or institutions whose impact on the making of independent films he acknowledges.
    Not finger-pointing 
    “I know what it is like to be a first-timer trying to get your film across the finish line,” he said. “In my day, you had to find a festival that would give you a cold audience. It’s important for filmmakers to find such an audience. It’s easy to fill up an auditorium with your friends—they may like [the film] because they like you. A cold audience gives you perspective; you will be told where the bad spots are.”

    This is not a case of finger-pointing, Kidlat said. “I’m not downgrading the achievements of Cinemalaya stalwarts. I appreciate what they have done so far. However, the money mentality seems to [indicate] that it’s more efficient to put together the little leaguers with the big boys. Then you forget your mission.”
    Thoughtfully, Kidlat asked, “What was your mission, Cinemalaya?”

    Allen Dizon won best actor at the 3rd Silk Road Film Festival in Dublin, Ireland, last Sunday for Jason Paul Laxamana’s “Magkakabaung,” which brought home the best film trophy as well.
    Dizon, who attended the fest, told the Inquirer via e-mail, “I’m still hung over from winning at the Sinag Maynila last Saturday … This is priceless. I can proudly share this honor with my children because it shows that, although I started in sexy movies, I was able to prove myself as an actor.”
    Laxamana, who is in the United States for the Cleveland IFF, said in the same e-mail: “We previously won in North America and Asia. And now, our first best film triumph from Europe. It feels good that our work is appreciated by people across different continents.”

    Milo Sogueco’s “Mariquina” will be shown at the 5th San Diego (United States) Asian Film Festival, April 16 to 25.
    In the fest website, critic Brian Hu describes the Cinemalaya film as a “loving tribute to reconciliation … a nostalgic tribute to [the shoemaking] craft … For a family and a nation hardened by missteps, [it’s] a lyrical reprieve, a gift wrapped in a shoe box, a pop song for the journey ahead.”
    Screening is set April 17, 6 p.m., at Ultrastar Mission Valley.–Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Raves for ‘Yolanda’ docu in US
    
    
    “Storm Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One”
    US trade publication Variety has given Lav Diaz’s documentary “Storm Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One” a rave review. Critic Ronnie Scheib describes the docu on children displaced by Supertyphoon “Yolanda” in Tacloban as “slow but striking.” He notes: “Diaz’s magnificent compositions frame children at work and at play amid utter devastation … . The abstract minimalism and ponderous stasis of Diaz’s camerawork … give a strangely timeless feel that complements its stark beauty.”
    Earlier, a website that focuses on documentaries likewise raved about “Storm Children.” Daniel Walber of nonfics.com wrote: “Diaz is interested in destruction but not exploitation, the prosaic lives of his subjects rather than the harsh poetry of their misfortune … the film’s final images are resoundingly complex, beautiful and confusing at once.” Walber saw the film as part of the Documentary Fortnight at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it was screened on Feb. 14 and 16.

    BAMBANTI (SCARECROW)
    Fresh from the success of his full-length film “M. (Mother’s Maiden Name),” which won the Special Jury Prize in the 2014 Metro Manila Film Festival-New Wave Section, screenwriter and director Dulay is back with his latest opus, “Bambanti (Scarecrow)”.
    Shot during the week-long Bambanti festival in Isabela, the film is about the relationship of a mother and son, and their quest for truth incited by a missing watch.
    Dulay said the film, which has a dash of sadness, was inspired by his childhood experience.
    “Bambanti still pushes [the story] of affection towards our mothers,” said Dulay. “This time we use bambanti as a metaphor for mothers because scarecrows are used to protect the crops. In the film, just like bambanti, a mother will do anything to protect her child.”
    “The story is so simple, but has a heart,” added Dulay.

    The film stars Alessandra de Rossi, Micko Laurente, Julio Diaz, Shamaine Buencamino and Lui Manansala.
    Dulay was the director of “Huling Halik” (The Last Kiss), a NETPAC entry in the 2011 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival. He also wrote the screenplays for Lawrence Fajardo’s “Posas,” Ed Lejanos’ “QWERTY,” Armando Lao’s “Ad Ignorantiam,” Jeffrey Jeturian’s “Ekstra” and Jay Altarejos’ “Kasal.” His short film “Missing” was included in the official selection of the 2013 Cinemalaya Film Festival, short film category and won the Best Short Film in 2013 URIAN Awards.
    
     
     
    SWAP
    If you are into unique forms of action-drama, then Zuasola’s “Swap” is something you should never miss, with main actors Dionne Monsanto, Matt Daclan and Mon Confiado.
    “Swap” is a story of a young father torn between solving a crime and committing another crime. His only son is kidnapped and the criminals demand that he steal another child in exchange for his son’s life.
    The film, with the actors speaking in Cebuano language, is loosely based on real events, as Zuasola revealed that he was a kidnap victim as a child.
    “It is based on my parents’ recollection and from other people who were present when it happened,” said Zuasola.
    He says the movie has a touch of fantasy because he didn’t experience everything in it firsthand.
    The Cebu-based director says “Swap” induces a feeling of nostalgia.
    “When pain passed, it becomes joy. When you experience something painful in the past, and when you try to recall it, you feel happy that you got through it…that’s the effect of ‘Swap’,” he said.
    Zuasola also shared how he almost gave up because of the impossibility of making the movie, which was shot continuously in one hour and 30 minutes with no cuts.
    He directed more or less 40 actors, coming and going in five settings including a house, an army camp, a tailoring shop, a mansion and a hospital.
    He said: “I told them (the whole crew) ‘Brace yourself because we will suffer in this film. This is not an easy film to make but nonetheless we have to make it possible. We are not filmmakers, we are not artists. We are miracle makers.’”
    Zuasola is a recipient of the Ani ng Dangal Award for his dedication to the cultivation of modern Cebuano cinema. In 2009, he won the Ishmael Bernal Award for most outstanding young Filipino filmmaker for his short film “To Siomai Love” from the Cinemanila International Film Festival. His first feature length film “Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria” bagged top awards from Gawad Urian such as best picture, best cinematography, best musical score and best director. He recently showcased his second feature “Soap Opera” under Cinema One Originals Film Festival.
    
     
     
    IMBISIBOL
    Inspired from the one-act play written by Herlyn Gail Alegre for Virgin Labfest in 2013, Fajardo’s “Imbisibol” follows the lives of four Filipinos in Japan—Linda, Benjie, Manuel and Rodel.
    “Imbisibol” pertains to overseas Filipino workers, or ‘TNTs” (Tago nang Tago), the undocumented people who constantly change jobs and identities to elude immigration authorities. “Bilog,” which means zero, numberless or non-existent, is another monicker for them.
    The film presents a narrative of daily challenges faced by Filipinos in Japan during a period when thousands of undocumented workers and overstayers were being deported in response to strict Japanese laws.
    Amid their individual struggles, the characters will all be entangled in an agonizing game of hide and seek. They have to stay invisible,  for it is the only way to survive.
    As threats of arrest and deportation looms closer and everyone’s future becomes at stake, friendships are tested; loyalties are questioned; and values are eroded.
    JM De Guzman, Ces Quesada, Bernardo Bernardo, Allen Dizon and Ricky Davao lead the cast of “Imbisibol”.
    Fajardo says he wants to tell how desolate the lives of Filipinos abroad are.
    “They are the ones who do something illegal so they can do something good for the country and for their respective families,” he says.
    Fajardo, a Bacolod native, directed “Amok”, which won Best Sound and Editing at the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival in 2011. “Amok” was shown in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, USA, Canada and Italy. It also won Best Sound and Editing in the Natatanging Gawad Urian in 2012 and bagged the Special Prize of the Jury Award at the Detective Fest in Moscow, Russia in the same year.
    Fajardo’s other movie “Posas” was the Cinemalaya’s Best Film in the Director’s Showcase Category in 2012.  It was shown at 12 festivals in five continents around the globe. It became even more successful when it took home the Best Film award in the Hanoi International Film Festival in 2012.
    
     
     
    NINJA PARTY
    Libiran’s “Ninja Party” is the most daring if not the most controversial feature in the festival’s line-up.
    It is a coming of age, drama movie where teens get to discover and explore their identity and sexuality.
    The film is set in an elite Catholic high school, where some female students furtively join a secret orgy with anonymous boys. When rumors spread about their participation in the covert activity, they deal with the subsequent conflicts with themselves, their families and the school.
    Libiran relates how he was surprised with the performance of his chosen actors.
    “When it came to the point that they (the girls) are being run after by the school principal and their families, their dramatic acting is so excellent,” he said. “I believe their acting is partly  confessional and revelational in a way they let us boys see the hidden side of our culture.”
    Libiran says wild soirees among students has been an urban myth for years now. But a lot of people say these really happen, as attested to by some of his sources.
    He says he doesn’t like the stand of different institutions about premarital sex among teenagers.
    “Because when you say “No to sex”, and yet they do have sex, they just hide until they get pregnant or contacted STDs. That’s where the problem starts,” he said.
    “Society should have an open-mindedness about it … that sex is not bad,” he said. “This is a hidden aspect of our culture. We Filipinos must stop being hypocrites and show in full glory that yes, we are sexual.”
    “It is a social concern because if we do not discuss it, and we just prevent them from doing it, we just leave our children, our brothers and sisters, helpless,” he concluded.
    Among the members of the cast of “Ninja Party” are Annicka Dolonius, Julz Savard, Bea Galvez, Elora Espano, Mariz Reyes, Japo Parcero, Odette Khan, Teresa Loyzaga and Denise Marasigan.
    Jim Libiran directed the short film “Pancit Canton,” which was his directorial debut in 2006. His other full-length features are “Tribu” (2007) and “Happyland” (2010). He wrote and directed the short film “Batch 2011”, a feature in the ABS-CBN News KINSE Human Rights Film Anthology. He also worked as creative producer to Bianca Catbagan’s “Suntok sa Buwan” and “Araw,” a short film produced by SunLife Financials Asia and KymeChow Media.
    
     
     
    BALUT COUNTRY
    Do you want to know a hidden story behind our favorite street food balut?
    In Sta. Ana’s “Balut Country,” actor Rocco Nacino plays the character of Jun, a bachelor who inherits a “balut” farm from his late father.
    He unexpectedly impregnates his girlfriend. And with his first child on the way, he decides to be practical and begins contemplating on selling the farm.
    But there are people who will be direly affected by his decision—the farm’s loyal caretakers, like Dado, played by Ronnie Quizon, who has toiled in the farm for a decade.
    Sta. Ana said the story was partly rooted in his experience.
    “My family has its own business but not necessarily a ‘balut’ farm,” he says. “When you are an artist usually you are more focused in your passions in life. You try as much as possible to be passionate about what your doing. But when your family leaves a business in your hands, it ignites your practicality, especially if your a man who wants to build your own family. You have to be practical in life.”
    Sta. Ana shares that the poetic approach to “Balut Country” is what differentiates it from his other masterpiece “Oros.”
    “‘Oros’ is very social realist. ‘Balut Country’ is very poetic since there are many objects that would symbolize something aside from the literal things. Most of the objects you’ll see in the film are metaphors,” he said.
    Sta. Ana says the Philippines is rich in culture but there are so many things left unexplored. He thinks the “balut” or duck egg industry must be used as a milieu and portrayed in another light.
    “We know what is ‘balut’. We know it is disgusting. But where does it come from? I think the international viewers would appreciate the ‘balut’ more if they get to see how it affects the lives of Filipinos,” he said.
    Sta. Ana is a Philosophy graduate at the Ateneo de Manila University. He is a writer and director of GMA Network. In 2010, he received a Balanghai trophy from the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival for “Mayohan.”  He has since earned nominations from the the Young Critics’ Circle, the Star Awards for Film and the Gawad Urian for his screenplays (Mayohan, Bisperas, Oros) and direction (Oros). His film Oros (The Coinbearer) was the opening film of the 2012 Asiatica Filmediale in Rome, Italy. It also won Best Film in the DC Independent Film Festival.

    “It was an unexpected blessing. It serves as inspiration for aspiring indie filmmakers and producers like me … that we can compete alongside foreign films,” Cabrido said. The jury called Cabrido’s film “surprising.” Both films are products of last year’s Cinemalaya.

    <content>‘Mandirigma’ director: Film idea came before Mamasapano tragedy
    
    
    REAL Marines acted as consultants.
    TERNATE, Cavite—“We need to make more films that depict love of country… this project is one of them,” said journalist-filmmaker Arlyn de la Cruz, whose “Mandirigma” tells the stories and struggles of the Philippine Marines.
    De la Cruz denied that she was riding on public interest in the Mamasapano tragedy. She had been working on the story since October 2014, she said. The clash where 44 members of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force died took place in late January.
    “I finished the script second week of January. If my film reminds viewers of Mamasapano, it’s just because police officers and Marines are all warriors,” De la Cruz noted. “Even members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (whom the SAF 44 fought and lost to) are warriors—although for different causes and beliefs.”

    De la Cruz’s debut movie, “Maratabat,” about people who rallied against an abusive and corrupt leader, was an official entry to the New Wave section of the 2014 Metro Manila Film Festival.

    “Maybe another movie will be done about SAF 44. This one is about the Marines—what they are like in battle, what sacrifices they make,” De la Cruz told Inquirer Entertainment during a visit to the set inside the Marine Barracks of Camp Gregorio Lim here, four hours away from Manila.
    THE PEG for Mon Confiado’s antagonist character was Marwan.
    Close to the truth
    De la Cruz, an Inquirer reporter, has covered the Marines since the early 1990s. “I’ve reported many times about their victories and defeats, the situation at the front lines,” she said. “Most of us get to read only about the number of soldiers who perish in an encounter, but we don’t really know how they die. This movie will be as close as possible to an actual battle.”
    A group of Marines serves as De la Cruz’s technical advisers. Most are members of the Reconnaissance Force. “I’ve known them since the ’90s, yet I still have to ask them very important details. For example, what actually happens during an assault? The consultants show the actors accurate moves. In one assault scene, real Marines join the actors.”
    Luis Alandy plays the central character, Capt. Arlan Salcedo. De la Cruz related, “The character ties two very important events depicted here—one happened in 2006, the other in 2014. Salcedo was a lieutenant in 2006 and is promoted to the rank of captain. He encounters the same enemies he fought in 2006 but, this time, armed with proper training to defeat them.”
    “Mandirigma” also features Ping Medina, Alwin Uytingco, Victor Basa, Marc Solis, Carlo Cruz, Jericho Ejercito, Ken Anderson, Alvin Fortuna, Roland Inocencio, Dennis Coronel and Mon Confiado as the main antagonist.

    “I admit that my peg for Mon’s character was [the late Zulkifli Abdhir, or] Marwan—so I named him Hamda Marawan,” said De la Cruz. “When Mon called my attention to this, I said I didn’t intend it to hit so close to home.”

    Another film festival steps up to help independent filmmakers. Sinag Maynila, spearheaded by 2009 Cannes Film Festival best director Brillante Ma. Mendoza and Solar Entertainment, will present five new works: Paul Sta. Ana’s “Balut Country,” Zig Dulay’s “Bambanti,” Lawrence Fajardo’s “Imbisibol,” Jim Libiran’s “Ninja Party” and Remton Siega Zuasola’s “Swap.”

    Accurate timing
    The timing of Sinag Maynila, set March 18 to 24 in seven SM malls, couldn’t be more accurate, especially since Cinemalaya’s full-length competition was scrapped this year. (Cinemanila and Cine Filipino had no 2014 editions, either.)
    Mendoza told the Inquirer that it is vital to hold film festivals like Sinag Manila, as much in a time of glut as scarcity.
    “The more festivals, the better for filmmakers. There are a lot of talented directors in the Philippines,” Mendoza said. “This is the right time to support Filipino artists, now that we are recognized internationally.”
    That is precisely Sinag Maynila’s “ultimate goal,” he said: “To go beyond film festivals and secure distribution deals with foreign companies. It’s not going to be easy. But it’s best to aim high.”
    Wilson Tieng, Solar CEO and fest cofounder, told the Inquirer, “Our support will not end with sending our films to festivals abroad. We will help filmmakers all the way. Apart from cinemas, other platforms can be tapped—online, DVD, mobile, cable, free TV.”

    Tieng, who has been attending A-list festivals like Cannes for years, is keenly aware that “distribution” is the next hurdle to make indie filmmaking a sustainable enterprise.

    Same wave length
    “Brillante and I are on the same wavelength on account of our exposure to the international film festival circuit,” Tieng explained. “Definitely, he is the perfect partner for me.”
    For Sinag Maynila, Solar and Mendoza have likewise teamed up with SM cineplexes. SM opens the doors of seven of its malls to the weeklong fest—Mall of Asia, Aura, Fairview, North Edsa, Megamall, Southmall and Manila.
    Millie Dizon, SM senior vice president for publicity and marketing, assured the organizers that the films will not be pulled out even if they fail to draw in crowds. “The movies are assured a weeklong run,” she promised. No first day-last day for Sinag Maynila.
    Big risk
    Mendoza acknowledged that Tieng and SM are taking a big risk supporting alternative films. “We need to create an audience for nonformula films,” the filmmaker said. “We hope students will flock to the theaters. At the same time, we want the films to have a life beyond Sinag Maynila. We’re planning school screenings—and the directors have the option to hold a theatrical run after the fest.”
    Mendoza is encouraging the filmmakers to actively promote and market their films. “I’ve asked them to take responsibility for their works,” he related.
    Dynamic interaction
    He recalled having a dynamic working relationship with the five directors. “I am familiar with their styles because I’ve worked with them previously. Instead of just mentoring them… the process was more collaborative.”

    Tieng said he was impressed with this year’s batch. “I was moved to tears by the screenplays. The stories are personal and heartfelt.”
    Mendoza described the five entries as diverse. “The films tackle different Filipino stories. Three are set in the regions, with Cebuano (“Swap”), Ilocano (“Bambanti”) and Kapampangan (“Balut Country”) lines of dialogue. The other two were shot in Manila (“Ninja Party”) and in Fukuoka and Asahikawa, Japan, (“Imbisibol”).
    Real-life story
    “Swap” is based on a real-life kidnapping incident. “Balut Country” focuses on a dying poultry industry in Candaba. “Bambanti” tells the story of a boy accused of theft. “Ninja Party” exposes teenagers’ sexual escapades. “Imbisibol” sheds light on the struggles of undocumented Filipino workers in Japan.
    Sinag Maynila will be an annual event, Tieng vowed. “On our first year, we are taking baby steps. Next year, we hope to increase the number of films.”

    <content>New tilt for local filmmakers
    
    
    The Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), organizer of the World Premiere Film Festival (WPFF), has added another section to this year’s film derby to be held in June. The “Filipino New Cinema” section will feature the latest from local directors who are “looking to make their presence felt in the cinematic world,” announced FDCP chair Briccio Santos.
    A maximum of five films will be screened under the new section. The entries will compete for top awards, prizes and incentives, according to an article posted on the FDCP website.
    The awards will include best picture (1st and 2nd place), best screenplay, cinematography, editing, musical score, sound engineering, production design, as well as best actor, actress, supporting actor and supporting actress.

    The WPFF’s goal is to bring together different countries in a world-class festival held in the Philippines, said Santos. Qualified entries are films that have yet to be screened elsewhere prior to the festival scheduled from June 24 to July 7.
    The deadline for submission of entries for the Main Competition is on April 10, and April 17 for Cine Verde and Parallel sections. Other sections are Euroview, Asean Skies and Ibero America. The 2015 WPFF will run almost a week longer than last year’s edition. It will coincide with the International Film Expo, which will be held from June 26 to 28.

    “Awesome,” Filipino actor Archie Alemania described the experience of attending the 30th Film Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, California, on Feb. 21. His film, Lav Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” was nominated for best international film.
    Archie and fellow actor Sid Lucero, plus Lav and producer Moira Lang, got to hobnob with Hollywood A-listers.
    Via e-mail, Archie told the Inquirer: “Even though we didn’t win, we are proud to have represented the Philippines and walked among the stars.” (Pawel Pawlikowski’s “Ida” of Poland won.)

    He recalled that Benicio Del Toro and Zach Galifianakis declined photo-ops and a bodyguard kept Oprah Winfrey away from snapshot seekers. He almost failed with Winfrey’s “Selma” costar and best actor nominee David Oyelowo, Archie said, but he persisted until Oyelowo agreed.

    PEPE Diokno directs Ruru Madrid (foreground, seated) in “Above the Clouds.”
    Pepe Diokno’s second full-length feature film “Above the Clouds” earned a rave review from the US trade publication Hollywood Reporter. Critic Clarence Tsui, who reported that the Filipino-French coproduction was shown at Berlin’s European Film Market, described it as an “emotional journey … about grief and loss.”
    Tsui said Diokno “has morphed and matured” since winning two prizes in Venice for his “gritty” debut “Engkwentro” in 2009. “His sophomore effort swaps subtle storytelling and sumptuous visuals for his former preoccupations with genre filth and fury,” Tsui said.
    Diokno was praised for “[not stooping] to caricature or cliché as he highlights the differences between young and old, modernity and tradition … Instead, he unceasingly celebrates the beauty of rural Philippines.”

    “Above the Clouds” was picked up by French sales agent Doc &amp; Film International, according to producer Bianca Balbuena. Bayani San Diego Jr.

This event in Mexico City is organized by Unam—National Autonomous University of Mexico. In the fest website, critic Eva Sangiorgi describes the Locarno winner as “a film of mythical tones and historic intention [offering] the essence of cinema, a filmic state of purity in which [the visuals] allow memory to breathe and where space and time become void.”

    Two Filipino filmmakers are among the grant recipients of the Doha Film Institute this year. Mikhail Red’s full-length feature film “Birdshot” and Jewel Maranan’s documentary “Tondo, Beloved” are among those included in the program which “supports new cinematic talents.” The two projects will receive funding for development (Maranan) and production (Red). Red and Maranan were among the honorees in the Inquirer Indie Bravo! Awards last December. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Lav Diaz’s “Batang West Side” has a new home. The family of producer Tony Veloria turned over 30 cans (two print copies, subtitled and nonsubtitled) of the five-hour movie to the National Film Archive. “The prints will be saved … for future generations,” Diaz said. Negative masters and a print copy are in the Vienna (Austrian) Film Museum for safekeeping, said Diaz. Veloria died in a bus accident in 2012. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    “STORM Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One”
    US trade paper The Hollywood Reporter praised Lav Diaz’s documentary, “Storm Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One,” in a review that came out Jan. 19. Critic Clarence Tsui described the docu, on young people displaced by Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” as “poetic… visually riveting, heart-rending.”
    Tsui said Diaz’s “achingly beautiful camera work never obscures the anguish… instead [it heightens] the desolation of the… wind-swept terrain.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>Lav Diaz docu on Sight and Sound’s best list
    
    
    “Storm Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One”
    “Storm Children (Mga Anak ng Unos), Book One,” Filipino filmmaker Lav Diaz’s film on Supertyphoon “Yolanda,” is one of the 25 best documentaries of 2014 on a year-end list drafted by the prestigious magazine Sight and Sound, published by British Film Institute.
    Critic Robert Greene described the docu as a “haunting, elegiac report by one of our greatest living filmmakers from a village in the Philippines that was devastated by … the most powerful typhoon on record.”

    “La Última Película”
    Raya Martin and Mark Peranson’s “La Última Película,” currently showing at Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center in New York, was named the New York Times’ Critics’ Pick in an article published on Jan. 9. In his review, critic Andy Webster described the film, a tribute and critique of Dennis Hopper’s “The Last Movie,” as a “goofy, dazzling riff.” Webster lauded Martin and Peranson’s “exuberant, often lyrical imagery … blithe humor,” adding, “Mr. Hopper, onetime enfant terrible, would be pleased.”
    The Film Society of the Lincoln Center website pointed out: “Martin and Peranson have created an unclassifiable work that mirrors the contortions and leaps of the medium’s history and present.” “La Última Película” screenings will end tomorrow. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    <content>CineKasimanwa opens with the 4-hour PH entry to Oscars
    
    
    The most anticipated film festival in Region VI opens with the country’s Oscar entry. “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan (Norte, the End of History) which was screened first at the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival 2013, is one of the most awarded films in recent memory and one that has even pushed filmmaker Lav Diaz’s reputation as one of the country’s top filmmakers. In Norte, loves of three people (Sid Lucero, Archie Alemania, Angeli Bayani) take an interesting turn when one of them commits a crime and someone else gets accused for it.

    CineKasimanwa Festival Director and Programmer (also a filmmaker) Elvert de la Cruz Bañares explained that the selection of Norte was more than just the fact that Lav’s parents were from Iloilo: “When we open festivals, we set the tone and mood for the audiences. Norte narrates a humble story that gets complicated and emotionally challenging as it progresses. It is told through visually haunting images that forebodes. How can you ignore something like this one?”

    Apart from Norte, there are ten other full-length films that are part of the festival: “Dapya Sang Paglaum”, the new documentary by TM Malones (Salvi: Ang Pagpadayon); “My Fake American Accent”, a funny take on the lives of call center agents directed by Ned Trespeces who is from Arevalo, Iloilo City; “Wanted: Boarder”, a horror film with kick by Ray Gibraltar from Guimbal whose other film “Brod” explores sensitive themes of brotherhood, sexuality, fraternity and more; “Namets!” by Bacolod filmmaker Jay Abello (Pureza) which is a charming story about two lovebirds using Bacolod food as its theme; “Tumbang Preso” a film by Ilonggo filmmaker Kip Oebanda about human trafficking; “Trabaho” by Ned Trespeces; “T’yanak” by master filmmakers Peque Gallaga &amp; Lore Reyes; “Little Azkals” about the path to glory of the little soccer kid players by Baby Ruth Villarama and produced by Ilonggo film producer Albert Almendralejo (who also produced Tumbang Preso); and “Dagyang” a mystical tour of the Iloilo culture and heritage through the eyes of the child by Joenar Pueblo.
    CineKasimanwa’s main aim is to support and promote films and filmmakers from the Western Visayas region. Now that the local filmmakers have an annual festival wherein they can showcase their works, a lot of the filmmakers from Iloilo were able to produce new films which shall be making its World Premiere: “Gaid”, the new film by Tara Illenberger (Durog, Guni-Guni) is about a crime of passion; “Gamhanan” by Joenar Pueblo; “Bantay Salakay” by Reymundo Salao; and Malones’ Dapya Sang Paglaum.
    This year, CineKasimanwa programming has paired the full-lengths with short films (mostly making their World Premiere or Film Festival Premiere) at the SM City Iloilo Cinema 1: Wowa by Joebert Casas (the Best Short Film winner of 2014’s Bantayan Film Festival in Guimbal) which will be the Opening Short Film; Yuhom by Blessel Toledo; Sino Si Mel Carreon? by Mia Reyes (with Mr. Carreon making his film fest debut appearance); Silong by Steven Asaph Reasol (named Best Director of the Summer at the 2014 Bakunawa Film Festival); Ang Paranublion by Eden Gilpo; and Bakunawa Film Fest winner Reverie by Angelica Pavillar.
    The curated Short Film Programs this year boasts of 60+ short films all divided into six programs: “Relasyon, Bala, Kulo, Dugo” collects films with domestic relationships, revenge and more; “Bagito Ang Panahon” is a collection of light films – both dramatic and comedy; “Sin-o Gid Bala Sila?” features four documentaries and three narratives about caring for loved ones; “Liwat Liwat” a free screening of twelve films by different student-filmmakers interpreting the same script; “The Best of CineKasimanwa 1” with a selection of some of the best shorts last year; and the annual “Moo-Moo-An Kag Fantasmagoria” the horror, adventure and fantasy program which will give 50% discount to people who will watch the films in costume and make-up.
    The film festival closes with the horror drama “Asin” which was beautifully shot in San Joaquin and finely directed by Aimee Apostol Escasa. The film which has a wonderfully-framed cinematography is about motherhood, local folklore and the secrets of the mountains.
    This year, the festival will also bring in actors and film directors who are part of the films programmed in the festival: Sid Lucero who is a main cast in both “Norte” and “T’yanak”‘; Alessandra De Rossi who makes a cameo in “T’yanak”; Albert Almendralejo, the Ilonggo producer of “Tumbang Preso” and “Little Azkals”; actress Tanya Lopez who will be featured in the red carpet launch of Robertine Films during the special screening of Little Azkals; Ned Trespeces, director of Trabaho and My Fake American Accent; Juan Carlo Rosales of OLX, our online festival partner; and Raymond Lee, producer of Norte: Hangganan ng Kasaysayan.
    Like last year, the festival donates 25% of each ticket to the Jaro Archdiocesan Social Action Center and Rebuild Project while the rest are equally divided into filmmaker’s and/or producer’s share; cinema rentals with SM City Iloilo Cinema 1; and the film festival operations. Tickets are priced at P120.00 for SM Cinema 1 (except for Norte at P200.00); P50,00 for UPV Cinematheque and FDCP Cinematheque.
    CineKasimanwa: The Western Visayas Film Festival is presented by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Department of Tourism – Region VI, OLX, The Negros Museum and the Film Development Council of the Philippines. It is supported by University of the Philippines in the Visayas Cinematheque, FDCP Iloilo Cinematheque, Globe Telecom, Epson, SM Supermalls, SM Cinema, E Unlimited and MTRCB.

    Angeli Bayani, who attended the festival in Tokyo, Japan, posted on her Instagram account: “Thank you so much to everyone who made this film possible–the staff, the crew, the cast. None of this would have been possible were it not for your passion and commitment to the project. Domo arigato gozaimasu, TOKYO FILMeX!!!”
    In the film, Bayani plays the character of Divina, a 35-year-old Manobo tribeswoman, who sets out a search for her missing daughter after a crocodile attack.

    <content>‘Red’: Beyond fixing life and love
    
    
    MANILA, Philippines—Love has no other color but red.
    This is what the actor Jericho Rosales’ character proves as he stars in a crime-romance movie “Red,” an official entry to the recently-concluded 2014 Cinema One Originals Film Festival.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Directed and co-written by Jay Abello, the film tells the story of Red, a fixer who hails from the heart of Negros and a passionate lover of Mai (Mercedes Cabral).

    Red’s bizarre job would instantly earn him a trophy deserving of a superstar: He fixes for free other people’s mess, from drivers’ problems on licenses, road accidents, debt-related squabbles and hold-up scenes in the neighborhood to the petty crimes and blunders committed by politicians, drug addicts and social bigwigs.
    Abello superbly utilizes the character of Milton (Nico Antonio), Red’s closest mate, as the movie’s narrator. Milton rhapsodizes Red’s life to his frenetic friends, the market butchers and vendors, with his story-telling skills that make them fall off their seats or shed their tears.
    But Milton’s memory has been lying in ambush for months. Behind his captivating voice is a secret he reluctantly keeps, a revealing telltale part that would complete Red’s legend.

    An arrestingly written script
    Nothing would be sweeter than Red’s endearing childhood. Though he is one of those children from the streets, he is treated as a real son by his foster father Molo, the owner of a nightclub.
    It seems the young Red takes on a new life when he meets Mai, a bubbly if not snippy young girl. So acute is his love for Mai that he impishly stalks her in the morning at school while he serves the club patrons at night.
    Red, as charismatic and benevolent as he is, eventually becomes a maven in the field, just one call away by influential thugs or crooks. He has gotten where he is by dint of kindness, ambition and hard work. As he evolves from zero to hero, Mai remains oblivious of his true job.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    With Abello’s arrestingly written script, the weight and size of drama draw out to its own capacity, eliciting the gut-wrenching sentiment that no sacrifice is too great if it would be for the only one you love.
    The manner by which he juxtaposes Red’s battle for others, for his life and ultimately for his love, calcifies the film’s sturdy backbone.
    When Red inadvertently loses Mai and he becomes embroiled in an inbreeding crime instigated by Art Ledesma (JM Rodriguez), that is when he starts to struggle without quarters against the ravages of time.
    Setting off on an adventure
    Watching “Red” is like setting off on an adventure from which there is no turning back. Its frisky pace and suspense feel congruently blend to the dramatic brunt it packs.
    JM Rodriguez has his natural talent of simulating the smug, capricious and happy-go-lucky son of a congressman. Art’s role proves to be conducive in reinforcing the film’s unpredictability. The ploy he lays out to vilify “Red” grittily maintains the movie’s dash of thriller until the end.
    Worthy of his supporting role, Antonio surprises the viewers with his measured movements and demeanor. Being a perky but a professional radio drama actor is definitely the last thing one could think of as his main racket.
    Cabral, meanwhile, aptly uses her expressive eyes to convey Mai’s bottled-up woes. Her underpass scene with Jericho is an agonizing and visceral part that caps the film’s real purpose.
    Rosales, apart from his usual matinee image and mainstream bearing, has something different to deliver this time. He spruces up Red’s fascinating personality with deliberate gestures, placid composure and admirable tenacity.
    One may expect much from “Red” like stuffing itself with bloody shootouts or neatly choreographed fight routines. But that doesn’t seem to be Abello’s clever motive.
    You could strip away his stealth job, the crimes he covers up or the outlaws he works for, and what remains is a problematic piece of his personal life—his somber and convoluted affair with Mai. The thorny irony that Red could fix other peoples’ fiascoes when he couldn’t bring himself to fix his is an awakening that will creep through the viewers’ insides like a stray bullet.
    Oh and before we forget, two interesting figures appear in the film. Award-winning iconoclastic indie filmmaker Jim Libiran (“Tribu,” “Happyland”) and Pinoy Rock icon Joey “Pepe” Smith add a rather “rakenrol” color to what is already a rogue narrative.
    With its crafty and engaging music, editing and cinematography, “Red” is a film that should never go amiss. It is one of those moments when you step out the theatre and says, “Thanks, I get my money’s worth!”

    MANILA, Philippines—The ongoing Cinema One Originals has “InTENse” for its motto this year as it celebrates its 10th year.

    Ritesh Batra’s “The Lunch Box” a feel-good heartwarming Indian movie and Elwood Perez’s wayward , if not bizaare, “Esoterika: Maynila” were screened in a full-house opening gala last Sunday.

    “Nuwebe” (international title: “Termitaria”) was the only Philippine film that competed in the fest.

    Girl goes on a road trip to Leyte with campus cutie and childhood sweetheart to find the writer of a love letter and bask in the magic of a blue moon. Jadaone says Pascual and Estrada didn’t act like kids of celebrities on the set. “They love to perform; it’s in their genes.”
    Nightcrawler
    Directed by Dan Gilroy; stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Bill Paxton, Riz Ahmed

    Student butts heads with philosophy prof who challenges him to prove God’s existence. The Hollywood Reporter’s Stephen Farber: “Slickly produced … competent cast.” USA Today’s Claudia Puig differs: “Despite campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed.”
    The Drop

    Directed by Gregg Araki; stars Shailene Woodley, Christopher Meloni, Eva Green
    Young woman comes to terms with the sudden disappearance of her “perfect” mother. Philadelphia Inquirer’s Tirdad Derakhshani calls it “an enjoyable, if uneven, adaptation of Laura Kasischke’s novel.” New York Magazine’s Bilge Ebiri: “Evocative, gorgeous, occasionally maddening.”
    Horns
    Directed by Alexandre Aja; stars Daniel Radcliffe, Juno Temple, Max Minghella, Kelli Garner
    Horns sprout on the head of a man whose girlfriend is murdered. Entertainment Weekly’s Chris Nashwaty: “Made by people who couldn’t decide if it was a horror flick, a whodunit or a ‘Hellboy’ knockoff.” Daily Express’ Allan Hunter agrees: “Wacky … coarse black comedy, gory thriller.”
     
    The Devil’s Pact
    Directed by Dallas Richard Hallam, Patrick Horvath; stars Caity Lotz, Camilla Luddington
    Haunted by a dead serial killer, a woman teams up with the murderer’s niece to catch a copycat. New York Times’ Andy Webster sums it up: “Wispy, subtext-free material.” Variety’s Dennis Harvey: “Simply stretches out rather than elaborating on its predecessor’s already thin premise.”

    ANGELl Bayani (left) and Hazel Orencio in “Norte”: “A marvel of simplicity, depth and deviousness.”
    Lav Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan” won Best Picture at the Pancevo (Serbia) Film Festival held this week. The jury cited Diaz for “[confronting] the questions posed by Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s ‘Crime and Punishment’ with contemporary and different ideological concepts.”
    With the use of a “specific and original film language,” the jury said, “[the movie] tells a shockingly epic story which denounces contemporary civilization.” Among the jurors were Serbian actress Vladislava Milosavljevic, Croatian director Bobo Jelcic and Serbian critic Branislav Dimitrijevic.
    “Norte” is showing until Sept. 16 at Glorietta 4 (1 p.m., 6 p.m.), TriNoma (12:10 p.m., 5 p.m.), Greenhills Theater Mall (2:30 p.m., 7 p.m.), Robinsons Galleria (7 p.m.) and Robinsons Metro East (7 p.m.).

    Meanwhile, Diaz’s Locarno-winning film, “Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon” will be shown at Filmfest Hamburg (Germany), set Sept. 25 to Oct. 4. The fest website lauds the “brilliant” black-and-white images. “The five-and-a-half hour downward spiral earns the viewer’s attention with every passing minute,” it adds. The movie will be screened Sept. 27 and Oct. 3 in Germany.

    RONNIE Liang considers the shoot an “exposure trip” that took him to unfamiliar areas in the city, like the Chinese cemetery. INQSnap this page to view the trailer and more photos!
    Don’t count him out just yet.
    The recipient of the Cinema One Originals lifetime achievement honor last year, filmmaker Elwood Perez is not done making movies.
    Quick on the heels of his Sineng Pambansa 2013 entry “Otso,” he finished shooting “Esoterika: Maynila,” the second part of a planned trilogy on the creative process.
    ADVERTISEMENT
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Perez explained, “I have this trilogy in mind. ‘Otso’ is about a screenwriter and the power of imagination. ‘Esoterika: Maynila’ is about a komiks writer and the art of learning.”

    The yet-untitled third part of the trilogy will focus on a filmmaker who is losing his memory.
    Perez would be the first to admit that the trilogy could be considered autobiographical, in a roundabout way.
    He cowrote most of his films with frequent collaborators Toto Belano, Orlando Nadres, Jose Javier Reyes and Iskho Lopez. When he took a break from movie-making in the 1980s, he dabbled in komiks writing and created the fantasy serial “Bagwis.”
    As for the third part of the trilogy? Perez, who has just returned to the movies after 10 years, certainly seeks to immortalize his memories on screen.
    He described “Esoterika” as a “tribute” film. “I am paying homage to all the people I admire through this movie.”
    These were the friends and colleagues he met along his filmmaking journey, he said. “I want to make a film on learning, but I didn’t want it to be didactic. When I was young, my mother would often scold me for being pompous.”
    For “Esoterika,” he collaborated on the script with Jessica Zafra. (The writer was recently hospitalized.)

    The central character is a babe in the woods, an innocent lost in the big, bad city.
    For the longest time, Perez searched for the actor to play his protagonist.
    “A beautiful Chinese mestizo…Chino bello,” he described his hero.
    He initially approached controversial celebrity Hayden Kho, but that pursuit led nowhere.
    It was back to the drawing board for Perez.
    ELWOOD Perez shot guerrilla-style with his enterprising cast and crew in crowded places. Andrew Tadalan
    While driving along Edsa one day, he noticed a billboard for a local perfume brand and its endorser: singer Ronnie Liang.
     
    Like a sponge
    He finally found his Chino bello!
    “Ronnie’s character, Mario, is like a sponge. He has a keen understanding of the world, but he’s not trying too hard,” Perez said.
    Liang, a runnerup in the reality talent search “Pinoy Dream Academy” in 2006, makes his film debut in “Esoterika.”
    In a lot of ways, it was his baptism of fire. Liang described his role as “super sexy.”
    He Googled Perez’s name and found out that his director launched the careers of not a few sultry nymphets in the 1970s and 1980s: from Rio Locsin to Claudia Zobel.
    “He also made several award-winning movies starring Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos, so I knew I was in good hands,” Liang remarked. “He is a cabalen…from Pampanga like me.”
    “Esoterika,” which is produced by Rex Tiri’s T-Rex Productions, gave Liang the chance to work with Vincent Tañada and his theater troupe. “I learned a lot about professionalism from them. I made sure to watch their play ‘Bonifacio.’ I’d like to try theater someday.”
    He was also reunited with Boots Anson-Roa, who portrays a transgender in the film. “Tita Boots was one of our mentors in ‘Pinoy Dream Academy.’”
    Also in the cast are Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, Lance Raymundo, Snooky Serna, Tessa Prieto-Valdes, Frederico Olbes, Wig Tysmans and Jon Hall.
    For Liang, the shoot was like an exposure trip to the sweaty, seedy underbelly of Manila.
    “Direk Elwood shot guerrilla-style,” the neophyte actor recalled. “He took me to Intramuros, Quiapo, Chinatown and the University Belt. He wanted me to observe the crowd, to really get into character.”
    One scene featured the annual Nazareno procession. “He made me join the mob,” Liang said. “[Costar] OJ Mariano almost got beaten up by the devotees because they thought he was a real pickpocket.”
    Talk about cinéma vérité.
    “We have a cast of thousands,” Perez said, half in jest, half in earnest.

    ELMO Magalona admits that his “Villa Quintana” partner is his inspiration.
    He used to get tongue-tied when asked about his love life. Now, GMA 7 actor Elmo Magalona has become more forthright.
    It could be because of his “Villa Quintana” partner, Janine Gutierrez who, he admits, gives him true happiness.
    He struggles to put a label on their relationship, saying they are currently “getting to know each other.”

    “We are simply enjoying each other’s company. We’re exclusively seeing each other,” he says.

    He describes Gutierrez as a “breath of fresh air.”
    “She’s easygoing, but also a strong woman who knows what she wants in life,” he says.
    On Magalona’s 20th birthday on April 27, Gutierrez gave him a pair of Nike Roshe red-and-black running shoes.
    Magalona met her parents, Lotlot de Leon and Monching Gutierrez, when they visited the “Villa Quintana” set on separate occasions.
    Monching and Magalona’s late dad, Francis, were launched at the same time, in the 1984 youth flick “Bagets 2.” “They also starred in ‘Ninja Kids’ in 1986. What a small world,” Magalona says.
    If the actor can have his way, he wants to be in a movie like “Bagets” for the millennials or Generation Y.
    Iconic film

    “‘Bagets’ was an iconic movie for my dad’s [generation]. I want to make a landmark film for my own generation,” he says.
    He is crossing his fingers that “#Y,” his first indie film and Gino M. Santos’ entry in this year’s Cinemalaya, will be the breakthrough he is waiting for.
    It is a daring move, he admits.
    “I’m ready for the love scenes,” he says. “I don’t want to lose that role. I am studying the character thoroughly.”
    Magalona got a DVD of Santos’ previous Cinemalaya film, “The Animals,” to familiarize himself with the young director’s work.
    Before the cameras start grinding, he plans to hit the gym and sculpt his body to prepare for his scorching scenes in “#Y.”
    “It was my mom (and manager Pia) who told me about the movie,” he says. “When I read the script, I thought it would be a huge challenge. I really want to immerse myself in it and feel the character.”
    He acknowledges that working with acclaimed actress-turned-director Gina Alajar on “Villa Quintana” (which ends on June 6) primed him for future projects.
    “Janine and I had a workshop under Direk Gina before we started taping ‘Villa Quintana.’ Direk Gina taught us to be comfortable in front of the camera. That we should always feel relaxed and act naturally,” he says.
    He is also thankful to costars Raymart Santiago, Paolo Contis, Sunshine Dizon and the late Roy Alvarez for inspiring him to hone his craft. “They are all good actors and they push me to give my best every time.”
    Magalona was saddened by the sudden passing of his Tito Roy in February.
    “On the set, he was always prepared. Even after a long taping day, he remained energetic and enthusiastic. I saw in Tito Roy the traits of a dedicated actor,” he says.
    True calling
     
    Now, Magalona is certain acting is his calling.
    “Music will always be there. But I really want to excel as an actor. Before, I couldn’t concentrate…I got bad reviews. I gave myself a deadline: I should shape up…especially since I was working with seasoned actors. But now, acting makes me feel fulfilled and happy. I love my job!”

    US filmmaker Nathan Adolfson’s “A Thief, A Kid &amp; A Killer (TKK)” earned a rave review from the blog jasonwatchesmovies.
    The blogger described TKK, which was shot in the Philippines with Filipino actors, as “a tight little thriller … a very funny story made on a shoestring budget.”
    Filipino cast member Lance Raymundo wrote on Facebook that TKK’s screening at the recent Cinequest film festival in San Jose, California, was “packed.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    JAY ALTAREJOS (left) takes in an interview with a foreign journalist in Berlin.
    Filipino filmmaker Joselito “Jay” Altarejos’ “Unfriend” received favorable reviews at the recently concluded Berlin International Film Festival, where it was screened in the Panorama section. Stagescreen blog’s Sascha Krieger remarked: “A well-composed study of an unraveling soul after the loss of love.” Projektberlinale.de: “[The film] reminds us … how hurtful unrequited love is … and what happens when no one is there for you.” The South China Morning Post published an Associated Press report that described the Filipino indie film as “notable.”

    EDUARDO Roy Jr.
    Eduardo Roy Jr.’s Cinemalaya 2013 winner, “Quick Change,” got a rave review from US industry paper Variety. Critic Richard Kuipers described “Quick Change” as a “well-crafted” drama, noting, “the obsessive desire for youth and beauty [in] Manila’s transgender community is examined with documentary-like authenticity.” He hailed it as a “nonsensationalistic slice of life on the margins.” The film is in the Panorama section of the ongoing Berlin fest, with another Filipino film, Jay Altarejos’ “Unfriend.” “Quick Change” competes in the Vesoul (France) Festival of Asian Cinema Feb. 11-18.

    MANILA, Philippines – Filipino filmmaker Hannah Espia’s “Transit” was cited a special mention in the New Currents section of the 18th Busan International Film Festival, which concluded in South Korea today, Saturday.
    Producer Paul Soriano, who confirmed the news to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, said the New Currents jury described “Transit” as “a moving account of migrant life in Israel.”
    “The New Currents jurors awarded the special prize to ‘Transit,’ because it focused on an unknown dimension of life,” Soriano explained.

The fest website says “Sana Dati,” as “the last in Tarog’s ‘Camera Trilogy,’ once again explores truth and lies as filtered through the lens.” “Confessional” (2007) and “Mangatyanan” (2009) complete the trilogy.

    ELLEN Adarna and Arnold Reyes in “Ang Tag-araw ni Twinkle”
    Actor Arnold Reyes had to shed a lot of weight before assuming the role of a colon cancer patient in the Gil Portes drama “Ang Tag-Araw ni Twinkle.”
    Arnold lost almost 15 lbs. in under two months. Although it wasn’t required of him, Arnold told the Inquirer he felt he had to do it: “I watch (US actor) Johnny Depp, amazed at how different he looks in each character he tackles. I always change my look to fit a role. It motivates me.”
    In “Twinkle,” Arnold plays Ka Ruben, a former rebel who loses his wife in battle with the military. Thinking Ruben is dead, an Army general (Cris Villanueva) brings home his (Ruben’s) daughter and raises her. Years later, Ruben, dying of cancer, hopes to meet his daughter (Ellen Adarna).

    As part of his preparation, Arnold went to a hospital to observe colon cancer patients and researched at length about the lives of rebels.
    He had sleepless nights prior to shooting, Arnold admitted. “I kept thinking, ‘Can I pull this off?’ This happens every time. I guess that’s part of my process as an actor.”
    This has been a busy year so far for Arnold. He was cast in two entries in the 2013 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, “Purok 7” and “Liars,” and two Mes de Guzman movies, “Ang Kwento ni Mabuti” with award-winning actress Nora Aunor, and “Sitio.”
    Arnold said Ellen was a big revelation in “Twinkle.” He related, “She’s so natural and truthful. Sumasakay lang siya sa emosyon and doesn’t force it. I really hope this project will open more doors for her.”
    Just like her
    Ellen found her character very much like her. “I ran away from home at 13—I guess that makes you a rebel,” she said. “I can relate to Twinkle on many levels. I used to always fight with my mom, and my dad told her to just let me be.”
    Now 25, Ellen said she had no regrets, but admits, “There’s a price to pay for being a rebel. I got to do what I wanted but I didn’t get help from my parents. I was on my own. I know I’d have been more comfortable, had I stayed with my family, but I chose freedom.”

    Cinema Rehiyon Reloaded is ongoing at the Cine Adarna of the University of the Philippines in Diliman until Friday.
    On Wednesday, films from Luzon were shown; Thursday, from the Visayas; Friday, from Mindanao. One highlight of the event was the Philippine premiere of Mes de Guzman’s “Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Bakal” on Thursday.
    Other films in the lineup are Remton Siega Zuasola’s “Ritmo” (this year’s Urian best short) and Arnel Mardoquio’s “Ang Paglalakbay ng mga Bituin sa Gabing Madilim” (this year’s Urian best film), Peque Gallaga’s short “Bayi sa Aparador” (which stars Solenn Heussaff) and Nick Deocampo’s docu “American Beginnings of Philippine Cinema.” Also on the list is the short “Bohe Sons of the Waves” by sisters Nadjoua and Linda Bansil— the filmmakers kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu last month.

    For the first time in its 39-year history, Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) entries will all be shown in digital cinemas.
    By December, all cinema chains in the country would have converted from
    35-mm film to digital projection, said Tony Y. Reyes, the director behind the lucrative “Enteng Kabisote” franchise.

    Insiders believe there is still a lot of work to be done before the local film industry can totally adapt to the technological changes and challenges.
    For precisely this reason, the Multimedia Entertainment Arts Foundation (MEA) held the three-day “Movie Production for Digital Migration” workshop at SM North Edsa recently.
    The workshop panelists, both local and foreign, underscored the importance of standardizing practices and procedures to make the digital workflow more efficient and effective.
    John Tan, MEA officer, emphasized the need to streamline the ranks of postproduction companies (including Outpost, which he heads). Filmmakers and producers, he said, should collaborate only with “credible and trustworthy postproduction firms that would provide top quality service.”
    The difference
    Any enterprising young man with a laptop can claim to be a one-man postproduction firm, but there would surely be a difference in quality, depending on expertise, noted Tan.
    Raised during the workshop were issues that affected the last MMFF. One film had a problem with the framing of scenes that could not be solved in postproduction. This case emphasized the need for strict quality control as early as the filming stage, to prevent headaches down the line.

    Another movie company decided to cut costs by skipping one part of the DCP (Digital Cinema Package) process.
    (Digital Cinema Package is a collection of digital files used to store and play movies in digital cinemas. DCPs usually come in a hard disk format.)
    “The production company thought a mere USB would do,” Tan recounted.
    (A USB is a universal serial bus, a connection technology for attaching devices to a computer, providing fast data exchange.)
    On opening day, the DCPs conked out—resulting in significant losses at the tills.
    Such debacles could be easily avoided by adhering to a consistent and conscientious work process, Tan said.
    His Outpost has had considerable experience when it comes to festival films—whether for the art-house, commercial or international scenes.
    Outpost worked on several Cinemalaya finalists (including the Venice—winning film, Pepe Diokno’s “Engkwentro” in 2009).
    For last May’s Cannes International Film Festival, Outpost did the postproduction work on two Philippine entries—Adolfo Alix Jr’s “Death March” and Lav Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan.”

    Backup is important
    For the Cannes films, Outpost made three DCPs each for the two films. “Two copies were shipped to France and one was hand-carried by the filmmaker. Backups are important.”
    Tan watched “Norte,” a four-hour film, seven times, to make sure every image was perfect, every sound and dialogue in sync.
    For MMFF 2013, Tan advised producers to have multiple DCPs and spares as well— in anticipation of problems that may arise due to the holiday rush.
    “For example, Direk Tony, for his ‘Enteng’ movies, prefers to ingest (load DCP into the theater’s DCP server) in all cinemas ahead of schedule, even before he gets the final list of assigned theaters (for each entry) from the MMFF executive committee,” Tan explained. “If his film will not be shown in a particular cineplex, the moviehouse management can just ignore his DCP.”
    This strategy prevents last-minute scrambling and gridlock in ingesting films.
    Various industry stakeholders—from filmmakers to producers, from theater owners to postproduction technicians— participated in the discussions during the workshop.
    “It was an eye-opener,” said Reyes.
    Experts from Digital Magic Hong Kong (Percy Fung), Red digital cameras United States (Ryan Erwin), Cine Equipment Singapore (Ivan Tan), Technicolor Thailand (Christian Cortez, Warren Santiago and Chon Sirikhunt) and Optima Digital Philippines (Marilen Magsaysay and Marc Ambat) were among the speakers.
    The MEA is now finalizing follow-up workshops to focus on other aspects of the digital work process. Next in line is an in-depth seminar on Arri Alexa cameras.

    The spotlight is on the Philippines in this year’s Network of Asian Fantastic Films (NAFF), the project market of the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan).
    According to the fest’s website, every year a country is selected “to focus on the diversity of its cinema.”
    Seven Filipino filmmakers will be participating in the sixth edition of NAFF, which will be held from July 18 to 28 in South Korea. They will present their “genre” projects at the Puchon fest’s “Project Spotlight: The Philippines” in various meetings, pitching sessions and fora.

    Filipino filmmaker Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Thy Womb” won special mention-jury prize Alhambra de Oro at the 7th Granada Film Festival Cines del Sur held in Spain last week. Mendoza told the Inquirer that he felt elated upon hearing that his work had received a “standing ovation” at the fest where it was the opening film. “To win is a wonderful bonus. I am happy that the film was recognized.” The jury cited the film for “reflecting a remote reality.” Bayani San Diego Jr.

    YCC HONOREE Gutierrez Mangansakan II Facebook photo
    Underscoring the gap between mainstream and independent movies, studios ran away with the trophies from the Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP) Awards, while indies hogged the citations of the Young Critics Circle (YCC).
    Both groups announced their winners on June 1, but the results couldn’t be more different.
    For best film, YCC’s choice was Gutierrez Mangansakan II’s “Qiyamah”; FAP’s was Mark Meily’s historical epic “El Presidente” (produced by Viva, CMB Films and Scenema Concepts).

    “The win was unexpected. An international critic and film programmer who has been watching my career trajectory, thought ‘Qiyamah’ was my weakest work. I was pushing for my film ‘The Obscured Histories and Silent Longings of Daguluan’s Children,’ a critics’ favorite in the international festival circuit,” Mangansakan told the Inquirer.

    MARC Abaya received trophy for late mom Marilou Diaz-Abaya.
    Best performers
    YCC’s best performer award went to Nora Aunor for Brillante Ma. Mendoza’s “Thy Womb.” FAP awarded Angel Locsin the best actress trophy for a Star Cinema drama, Ruel S. Bayani’s “One More Try.” Other FAP acting prizes were won by another Star Cinema drama, Olivia M. Lamasan’s “The Mistress”; best actor, John Lloyd Cruz; supporting actress, Hilda Koronel; and supporting actor, Ronaldo Valdez.
    YCC noted that Aunor has set a record, winning the citation five times—previously in 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995.
    The group described “Qiyamah” as “poetic.” Mangansakan said winning the best film award was significant “because the YCC is known for its maverick choices. It is a validation that Mindanao cinema, Moro cinema in particular, is helping shape a more pluralistic Philippine cinema.”
    Produced by the Film Development Council of the Philippines, “Qiyamah” premiered at the first Sineng Pambansa June 2012 in Davao. Its international premiere was at the 7th Jogjakarta NETPAC-Asian Film Festival last December. Mangansakan said a US premiere is set next week at the New Filipino Cinema 2013 of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.
    PEQUE Gallaga is the recipient of the Manuel de Leon award.
    Other YCC winners
    Indie films topped other YCC categories: Arnel Mardoquio’s “Ang Paglalakbay ng mga Bituin sa Gabing Madilim,” best screenplay; “Qiyamah” and Adolfo Alix Jr.’s “Kalayaan,” best cinematography and visual design (Albert Banzon and Alix); “Kalayaan” and “Qiyamah,”  best sound and aural orchestration (Raphael Pulgar and Arnel Barbarona for the former and Teresa Barrozo and Ditoy Aguila for the latter); and “Qiyamah,” best editing (Barbarona and Mangansakan).

    Major FAP awards were divided among big-budget mainstream movies. Best director went to Lamasan for the adult drama “The Mistress.” Creative and technical honors were split between “The Mistress” and “El Presidente.” The first won best screenplay (Vanessa R. Valdez) and editing (Marya Ignacio); the latter won best cinematography (Carlo Mendoza), production design (Danny Red and Joel MV Bilbao), music score (Jessie Lasaten) and sound (Albert Michael Idioma).

    FAP’s Luna Awards was held at the QC Sports Club on Saturday. The YCC rites are set in July at UP Diliman.

    MANILA, Philippines—Five independent filmmakers will each get a cash grant of P2 million from the organizers of the annual Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival, according to festival director Ronald Arguelles.
    Directors Borgy Torre, Mes de Guzman, Miko Livelo, Adolfo Alix Jr. and Keith Sicat would be competing under the Cinema One Plus category, while 10 others, who each got a P1-million grant, would be featured under the Cinema One Currents, Arguelles told the Inquirer.
    Torre’s entry, titled “Kabisera,” is set in Bacolod City. It tells of one’s transformation from a naïve, innocent man to a ruthless father, friend, and eventually, a drug dealer.

    De Guzman’s psychological drama “Sitio” is about a family that returns from the city to the province in search of a simpler life. “They find more problems and setbacks instead,” Argulles shared. It is set in Nueva Vizcaya, where the director is currently based.

    “Blu Bustamante,” by Livelo, tells of the plight of an overseas Filipino worker in Japan who suddenly finds himself jobless. A friend introduces him to a sentai (squadron) director, who convinces him to double for Blue Force, a super hero character in an upcoming Japanese super hero show.
    Alix directs the drama film “Ang Alamat ng China Doll,” which was written by Lav Diaz. It tells of Helen, 25, who is about to graduate from high school and start a new life. “Things take a drastic turn when a journalist publishes an article about ‘China Doll,’ Arguelles reported.
    Sicat’s science fiction “Woman of the Ruins” tells of the strange experiences of the people on a storm-ravaged island when a person long assumed dead reappears. The incident ignites a frenzy of reactions, ranging from ecstatic religious fervor to fear.
    “An innovation this year is the formation of two sets of jurors for the two categories. Also, there are a lot of first-time directors that made it this year. The lineup has a younger vibe compared to other festivals. The concepts are more thought-provoking,” Arguelles shared.
    Included in the Currents category is Kristian Cordero’s period film “Angustia.” It is set in 19th Century Bicolandia, when a Spanish friar falls in love with a woman of indigenous origins. Conflict arises and paranoia drives the Spanish friar to murder.

    MANILA, Philippines—Erik Matti’s “On the Job” was selected to be part of the Directors’ Fortnight—making it the third Filipino film that will premiere in Cannes next month.
    Apart from Matti’s film, Lav Diaz’s “Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan (Norte, The End of History)” and Adolfo Alix Jr.’s “Death March” were earlier picked as part of the competitive  Un Certain Regard section.
    The Directors’ Fortnight will be held from May 16 to 26.

    Matti confirmed the news with the INQUIRER in an interview Tuesday.
    “It’s an exciting time for Filipino cinema,” he said. “The world will see different kinds of Filipino films. Cannes is a big cinema event.”
    The Directors’ Fortnight was established by the French Directors’ Guild in the wake of the students’ uprising in France in May 1968.
    According to its site, the goal of the Directors’ Fortnight is “to help filmmakers get discovered by critics and audiences alike.”
    Since its inception in 1969, the Directors’ Fortnight has served as “breeding ground where the Cannes film festival would regularly find its prestigious auteurs.”
    Before Matti, Filipino filmmakers Lino Brocka, Mike de Leon, Mario O’Hara, Brillante Ma. Mendoza, Raya Martin and Auraeus Solito had their works screened at the Directors’ Fortnight.
    “It’s heartening to be in the same roster as them. It’s a wonderful validation of our work,” Matti said.

    Matti, co-wrote the script with Michiko Yamamoto who penned the ground-breaking indie film “Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros.”
    Matti related that “On the Job” was inspired by a real-life corruption scandal that involved inmates being released for a day to work as hired killers for crooked politicians.
    In the website Twtichfilm.com, Matti’s film has been compared to the works of Hong Kong’s Johnnie To and Argentina’s Fabian Bielinski—famous for telling stylish, noirish stories filled with drama and suspense.
    “I guess it was just the easiest way to describe my film,” Matti remarked. “They are famous names in the crime drama genre. But what makes my film different is it’s not really hard-boiled action. It’s also a character study.”
    Meanwhile, Matti’s 2012 horror-comedy “Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles” will also be screened in the Far East Film Festival in Udine, Italy, from April 19 to 27, and in the New Filipino Cinema 2013, to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco from June 5 to 9.
    Matti was one of the honorees in the first Inquirer Indie Bravo! Tribute three years ago.

    Director Joanna Vasquez Arong and producer Bianca Balbuena’s project-in-development “The Sigbin Chronicles” has been selected for the Fabriques de Cinemas du Monde, to be held during the Cannes film festival in France in May. Balbuena explained that the Fabriques is “a project market… that allows the director and producer to pitch their project to possible international partners.”
    Its website noted that the program is open to “talented young filmmakers… working on their first or second film.” Balbuena said that “Sigbin” is Arong’s first fiction film, although her documentaries have been featured in international festivals.
    “Sigbin,” Balbuena related, is “a creature in Cebuano mythology that’s both feared and coveted.” “Joanna and I are both from Cebu. The film is about how the sigbin figures in the lives of three men—a revolutionary, a hitman and an artist—in their quest for freedom,” she said.

    Vincent Sandoval’s “Aparisyon” will compete at the 15th Deauville Asian Film Festival in France from March 6 to 10. The drama film is vying for the Golden Lotus or best picture honor.

Sandoval is one of last year’s Inquirer Indie Bravo! Tribute honorees. Bayani San Diego Jr.

    Jun Robles Lana’s Cinemalaya winner “Bwakaw” on Tuesday won three awards at the 19th Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema held in France— the Grand Prix de Jury International, High School award and Emile Guimet prize. The jury cited “its courage and delicate expressions of humanity, friendship, love and loneliness.” In 2009, Chris Martinez’s “100” also won the Emile Guimet award, which is handed out by Friends of the National Museum of Asian Arts of Paris. The High School Award is picked by student viewers, said Lana. “We are ecstatic that our film continues to reap recognition.” Lana and “Bwakaw” lead actor Eddie Garcia were honorees in the 3rd Inquirer Indie Bravo! Tribute held last December.
    Meanwhile, the makers of a Cebuano horror indie announced on Tuesday in Facebook that their movie won best feature film at the 11th Macabro International Film Festival held in Mexico City in August last year.
    Brandon Relucio and Ivan Zaldarriaga’s “Di Ingon ’Nato (Not Like Us)” competed with 13 other entries—from the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, among others—in the festival envisioned as a showcase of “classic and contemporary horror films.”

    AIMING FOR OSCAR. Top-billed by actor Eddie Garcia and Princess the dog, “Bwakaw” was hailed by a US journalist as “a true gem.” INQUIRER file photo
    MANILA, Philippines—A Philippine movie about a grumpy, old, gay man and his faithful dog has become an unlikely hit abroad while shaking the belief that local independent films have to focus on the darker side of life.
    The film, “Bwakaw,” named after the dog in the movie, is the Philippines’ entry for an Academy Award for best foreign film. While standing little chance of being short-listed, its heartwarming story is winning rave reviews overseas.
    It tells the story of Rene, a senior citizen who only recently realized he was homosexual. Embittered and lonely, he looks forward to his death, only to have Bwakaw, the dog, teach him the value of life.

    It hit the international circuit and Time magazine chose “Bwakaw” as one of 10 films to watch in the prestigious New York Film Festival held last month.
    ‘A true gem’
    On  Oct. 28, the movie won special mention in the Winds of Asia-Middle East section of the 25th Tokyo International Film Festival, along with Asoka Handagama’s “Him, Here After” of Sri Lanka and Zhang Yang’s “Full Circle” of China.
    In August, it was picked up by international firm Fortissimo for worldwide distribution.
    Prominent US industry film journalist Nathaniel Rogers also hailed the movie as “a true gem … and an absolutely worthy Oscar submission,” while Slant magazine called it “effervescently original.”
    Film’s appeal
    In recent years, Philippine independent cinema has carved out a reputation overseas for powerful, gritty films that often focus on the darker aspects of a country where corruption, poverty and conflict dominate society.

    The director and writer of “Bwakaw,” Jun Robles Lana, said he did not want to make a movie dealing with the darker side of Philippine life.
    “I didn’t want this movie to depress people. I wanted it to be enjoyable. You go to movies to be entertained and I wanted to retain that appeal. I wanted it to be fun,” he told Agence France-Presse.
    In mentor’s honor
    The movie is a tribute to Lana’s mentor, respected playwright Rene Villanueva, who died in 2007 and after whom the movie’s lead character is named.
    “I wrote it to honor my mentor so I wanted it to be a celebration of life. In order to balance the tone, it was important for me to include a lot of humor in the storytelling,” he said.
    Lana credits both Garcia, who ironically is best known for playing skirt-chasing lotharios, and the dog, a 2-year-old mixed breed named Princess, for much of the movie’s success.
    It has led to Princess, the dog, getting a starring role in her own fantasy TV series, “Aso ni San Roque” (the Dog of Saint Roche), which now has a huge local following on GMA 7, a major Philippine broadcaster.
    Although Lana, 40, has won many literary awards, he is well-versed in the commercial side of entertainment, having written many popular movies and serving as creative director of GMA 7.
    Entertaining the audience
     
    In that position, he oversees the production of many soap operas aimed at the masses.
    Lana said his commercial background had helped “Bwakaw” stand out.
    “It is an independent film but my sensibility as a commercial director also came into play while I was directing this film. I wasn’t just making this film for myself. I was also thinking about entertaining my audience,” he said.
    Social problems
    The best known of Filipino indie filmmakers, Brillante Mendoza, won a Cannes best director award in 2009 for his film “Kinatay” (Butchered), in which a prostitute is murdered and chopped to pieces by a crime syndicate.
    Mendoza’s latest movies to win international acclaim were “Captive,” which focused on kidnappings committed by the Abu Sayyaf group, and “Thy Womb,” which tells the story of the gentle, sea-faring Badjao tribe.
    “Captive” competed in Berlin this year and “Thy Womb” in Venice, also this year.
    Independent filmmaker Pepe Diokno, who won a 2009 Venice Film Festival prize for “Engkwentro” (Clash), a film about street gangs and death squads, said many directors were drawn to the social problems in their country.
    From the heart 
    But the stereotype that Philippine independent films were just about crime and poverty is no longer true, and “Bwakaw” is just one movie demonstrating their greater scope, according to Diokno.
    “‘Bwakaw’ is an example that you can make a film that is not about prostitution and violence and it can find an international audience because it had a good story that really came from the heart,” he said.
    The head of the Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP), actor-director Leo Martinez, said “Bwakaw” would in all likelihood not have the financial backing for a marketing campaign to get a final nomination for the Oscars. FAP is the organization tasked to choose the country’s Oscar entry.
    Martinez said a campaign to secure a nomination would involve sending out at least 1,000 DVDs of the movie to the academy members and putting costly advertisements in US magazines.
    “(But) if it is seen, it can be a contender,” he said.
